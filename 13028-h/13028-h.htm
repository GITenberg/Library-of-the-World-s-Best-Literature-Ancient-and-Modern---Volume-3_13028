<h2>BERTHOLD AUERBACH--(Continued from Volume II)</h2>
<p>"Do you imagine that every one is kindly disposed towards you?
Take my word for it, a palace contains people of all sorts, good
and bad. All the vices abound in such a place. And there are many
other matters of which you have no idea, and of which you will, I
trust, ever remain ignorant. But all you meet are wondrous polite.
Try to remain just as you now are, and when you leave the palace,
let it be as the same Walpurga you were when you came here."</p>
<p>Walpurga stared at her in surprise. Who could change her?</p>
<p>Word came that the Queen was awake and desired Walpurga to bring
the Crown Prince to her.</p>
<p>Accompanied by Doctor Gunther, Mademoiselle Kramer, and two
waiting-women, she proceeded to the Queen's bedchamber. The Queen
lay there, calm and beautiful, and with a smile of greeting, turned
her face towards those who had entered. The curtains had been
partially drawn aside, and a broad, slanting ray of light shone
into the apartment, which seemed still more peaceful than during
the breathless silence of the previous night.</p>
<p>"Good morning!" said the Queen, with a voice full of feeling.
"Let me have my child!" She looked down at the babe that rested in
her arms, and then, without noticing any one in the room, lifted
her glance on high and faintly murmured:--</p>
<p>"This is the first time I behold my child in the daylight!"</p>
<p>All were silent; it seemed as if there was naught in the
apartment except the broad slanting ray of light that streamed in
at the window.</p>
<p>"Have you slept well?" inquired the Queen. Walpurga was glad the
Queen had asked a question, for now she could answer. Casting a
hurried glance at Mademoiselle Kramer, she said:--</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed! Sleep's the first, the last, and the best thing in
the world."</p>
<p>"She's clever," said the Queen, addressing Doctor Gunther in
French.</p>
<p>Walpurga's heart sank within her. Whenever she heard them speak
French, she felt as if they were betraying her; as if they had put
on an invisible cap, like that worn by the goblins in the
fairy-tale, and could thus speak without being heard.</p>
<p>"Did the Prince sleep well?" asked the Queen.</p>
<p>Walpurga passed her hand over her face, as if to brush away a
spider that had been creeping there. The Queen doesn't speak of her
"child" or her "son," but only of "the Crown Prince."</p>
<p>Walpurga answered:--</p>
<p>"Yes, quite well, thank God! That is, I couldn't hear him, and I
only wanted to say that I'd like to act towards the--" she could
not say "the Prince"--"that is, towards him, as I'd do with my own
child. We began on the very first day. My mother taught me that.
Such a child has a will of its own from the very start, and it
won't do to give way to it. It won't do to take it from the cradle,
or to feed it, whenever it pleases; there ought to be regular times
for all those things. It'll soon get used to that, and it won't
harm it either, to let it cry once in a while. On the contrary,
that expands the chest."</p>
<p>"Does he cry?" asked the Queen.</p>
<p>The infant answered the question for itself, for it at once
began to cry most lustily.</p>
<p>"Take him and quiet him," begged the Queen.</p>
<p>The King entered the apartment before the child had stopped
crying.</p>
<p>"He will have a good voice of command," said he, kissing the
Queen's hand.</p>
<p>Walpurga quieted the child, and she and Mademoiselle Kramer were
sent back to their apartments.</p>
<p>The King informed the Queen of the dispatches that had been
received, and of the sponsors who had been decided upon. She was
perfectly satisfied with the arrangements that had been made.</p>
<p>When Walpurga had returned to her room and had placed the child
in the cradle, she walked up and down and seemed quite
agitated.</p>
<p>"There are no angels in this world!" said she. "They're all just
like the rest of us, and who knows but--" She was vexed at the
Queen: "Why won't she listen patiently when her child cries? We
must take all our children bring us, whether it be joy or
pain."</p>
<p>She stepped out into the passage-way and heard the tones of the
organ in the palace-chapel. For the first time in her life these
sounds displeased her. "It don't belong in the house," thought she,
"where all sorts of things are going on. The church ought to stand
by itself."</p>
<p>When she returned to the room, she found a stranger there.
Mademoiselle Kramer informed her that this was the tailor to the
Queen.</p>
<p>Walpurga laughed outright at the notion of a "tailor to the
Queen." The elegantly attired person looked at her in amazement,
while Mademoiselle Kramer explained to her that this was the
dressmaker to her Majesty the Queen, and that he had come to take
her measure for three new dresses.</p>
<p>"Am I to wear city clothes?"</p>
<p>"God forbid! You're to wear the dress of your neighborhood, and
can order a stomacher in red, blue, green, or any color that you
like best."</p>
<p>"I hardly know what to say; but I'd like to have a workday suit
too. Sunday clothes on week-days--that won't do."</p>
<p>"At court one always wears Sunday clothes, and when her Majesty
drives out again you will have to accompany her."</p>
<p>"A11 right, then. I won't object."</p>
<p>While he took her measure, Walpurga laughed incessantly, and he
was at last obliged to ask her to hold still, so that he might go
on with his work. Putting his measure into his pocket, he informed
Mademoiselle Kramer that he had ordered an exact model, and that
the master of ceremonies had favored him with several drawings, so
that there might be no doubt of success.</p>
<p>Finally he asked permission to see the Crown Prince.
Mademoiselle Kramer was about to let him do so, but Walpurga
objected.</p>
<p>"Before the child is christened," said she, "no one shall look
at it just out of curiosity, and least of all a tailor, or else the
child will never turn out the right sort of man."</p>
<p>The tailor took his leave, Mademoiselle Kramer having politely
hinted to him that nothing could be done with the superstition of
the lower orders, and that it would not do to irritate the
nurse.</p>
<p>This occurrence induced Walpurga to administer the first serious
reprimand to Mademoiselle Kramer. She could not understand why she
was so willing to make an exhibition of the child. "Nothing does a
child more harm than to let strangers look at it in its sleep, and
a tailor at that."</p>
<p>All the wild fun with which, in popular songs, tailors are held
up to scorn and ridicule, found vent in Walpurga, and she began
singing:--</p>
<blockquote>"Just list, ye braves, who love to roam!<br>
A snail was chasing a tailor home.<br>
And if Old Shears hadn't run so fast,<br>
The snail would surely have caught him at last."</blockquote>
<p>Mademoiselle Kramer's acquaintance with the court tailor had
lowered her in Walpurga's esteem; and with an evident effort to
mollify the latter, Mademoiselle Kramer asked:--</p>
<p>"Does the idea of your new and beautiful clothes really afford
you no pleasure?"</p>
<p>"To be frank with you, no! I don't wear them for my own sake,
but for that of others, who dress me to please themselves. It's all
the same to me, however! I've given myself up to them, and suppose
I must submit."</p>
<p>"May I come in?" asked a pleasant voice. Countess Irma entered
the room. Extending both her hands to Walpurga, she said:--</p>
<p>"God greet you, my countrywoman! I am also from the Highlands,
seven hours distance from your village. I know it well, and once
sailed over the lake with your father. Does he still live?"</p>
<p>"Alas! no: he was drowned, and the lake hasn't given up its
dead."</p>
<p>"He was a fine-looking old man, and you are the very image of
him."</p>
<p>"I am glad to find some one else here who knew my father. The
court tailor--I mean the court doctor--knew him too. Yes, search
the land through, you couldn't have found a better man than my
father, and no one can help but admit it."</p>
<p>"Yes: I've often heard as much."</p>
<p>"May I ask your Ladyship's name?"</p>
<p>"Countess Wildenort."</p>
<p>"Wildenort? I've heard the name before. Yes, I remember my
mother's mentioning it. Your father was known as a very kind and
benevolent man. Has he been dead a long while?"</p>
<p>"No, he is still living."</p>
<p>"Is he here too?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"And as what are you here, Countess?"</p>
<p>"As maid of honor."</p>
<p>"And what is that?"</p>
<p>"Being attached to the Queen's person; or what, in your part of
the country, would be called a companion."</p>
<p>"Indeed! And is your father willing to let them use you that
way?"</p>
<p>Irma, who was somewhat annoyed by her questions, said:--</p>
<p>"I wished to ask you something--Can you write?"</p>
<p>"I once could, but I've quite forgotten how."</p>
<p>"Then I've just hit it! that's the very reason for my coming
here. Now, whenever you wish to write home, you can dictate your
letter to me, and I will write whatever you tell me to."</p>
<p>"I could have done that too," suggested Mademoiselle Kramer,
timidly; "and your Ladyship would not have needed to trouble
yourself."</p>
<p>"No, the Countess will write for me. Shall it be now?"</p>
<p>"Certainly."</p>
<p>But Walpurga had to go to the child. While she was in the next
room, Countess Irma and Mademoiselle Kramer engaged each other in
conversation.</p>
<p>When Walpurga returned, she found Irma, pen in hand, and at once
began to dictate.</p>

<h3>THE FIRST FALSE STEP</h3>
<center>From 'On the Heights'</center>
<p>The ball was to be given in the palace and the adjoining winter
garden. The intendant now informed Irma of his plan, and was
delighted to find that she approved of it. At the end of the garden
he intended to erect a large fountain, ornamented with antique
groups. In the foreground he meant to have trees and shrubbery and
various kinds of rocks, so that none could approach too closely;
and the background was to be a Grecian landscape, painted in the
grand style.</p>
<p>Irma promised to keep his secret. Suddenly she exclaimed, "We
are all of us no better than lackeys and kitchen-maids. We are kept
busy stewing, roasting, and cooking for weeks, in order to prepare
a dish that may please their Majesties."</p>
<p>The intendant made no reply.</p>
<p>"Do you remember," continued Irma, "how, when we were at the
lake, we spoke of the fact that man possessed the advantage of
being able to change his dress, and thus to alter his appearance?
While yet a child, masquerading was my greatest delight. The soul
wings its flight in callow infancy. A <i>bal costum&eacute;</i> is
indeed one of the noblest fruits of culture. The love of coquetry
which is innate with all of us displays itself there
undisguised."</p>
<p>The intendant took his leave. While walking away, his mind was
filled with his old thoughts about Irma.</p>
<p>"No," said he to himself, "such a woman would be a constant
strain, and would require one to be brilliant and intellectual all
day long. She would exhaust one," said he, almost aloud.</p>
<p>No one knew what character Irma intended to appear in, although
many supposed that it would be as "Victory," since it was well
known that she had stood for the model of the statue that
surmounted the arsenal. They were busy conjecturing how she could
assume that character without violating the social proprieties.</p>
<p>Irma spent much of her time in the atelier, and worked
assiduously. She was unable to escape a feeling of unrest, far
greater than that she had experienced years ago when looking
forward to her first ball. She could not reconcile herself to the
idea of preparing for the <i>f&ecirc;te</i> so long beforehand, and
would like to have had it take place in the very next hour, so that
something else might be taken up at once. The long delay tried her
patience. She almost envied those beings to whom the preparation
for pleasure affords the greatest part of the enjoyment. Work alone
calmed her unrest. She had something to do, and this prevented the
thoughts of the festival from engaging her mind during the day. It
was only in the evening that she would recompense herself for the
day's work, by giving full swing to her fancy.</p>
<p>The statue of Victory was still in the atelier and was almost
finished. High ladders were placed beside it. The artist was still
chiseling at the figure, and would now and then hurry down to
observe the general effect, and then hastily mount the ladder again
in order to add a touch here or there. Irma scarcely ventured to
look up at this effigy of herself in Grecian costume--transformed
and yet herself. The idea of being thus translated into the purest
of art's forms filled her with a tremor, half joy, half fear.</p>
<p>It was on a winter afternoon. Irma was working assiduously at a
copy of a bust of Theseus, for it was growing dark. Near her stood
her preceptor's marble bust of Doctor Gunther. All was silent; not
a sound was heard save now and then the picking or scratching of
the chisel.</p>
<p>At that moment the master descended the ladder, and drawing a
deep breath, said:--</p>
<p>"There--that will do. One can never finish. I shall not put
another stroke to it. I am afraid that retouching would only injure
it. It is done."</p>
<p>In the master's words and manner, struggling effort and calm
content seemed mingled. He laid the chisel aside. Irma looked at
him earnestly and said:--</p>
<p>"You are a happy man; but I can imagine that you are still
unsatisfied. I don't believe that even Raphael or Michael Angelo
was ever satisfied with the work he had completed. The remnant of
dissatisfaction which an artist feels at the completion of a work
is the germ of a new creation."</p>
<p>The master nodded his approval of her words. His eyes expressed
his thanks. He went to the water-tap and washed his hands. Then he
placed himself near Irma and looked at her, while telling her that
in every work an artist parts with a portion of his life; that the
figure will never again inspire the same feelings that it did while
in the workshop. Viewed from afar, and serving as an ornament, no
regard would be had to the care bestowed upon details. But the
artist's great satisfaction in his work is in having pleased
himself; and yet no one can accurately determine how, or to what
extent, a conscientious working up of details will influence the
general effect.</p>
<p>While the master was speaking, the King was announced. Irma
hurriedly spread a damp cloth over her clay model.</p>
<p>The King entered. He was unattended, and begged Irma not to
allow herself to be disturbed in her work. Without looking up, she
went on with her modeling. The King was earnest in his praise of
the master's work.</p>
<p>"The grandeur that dwells in this figure will show posterity
what our days have beheld. I am proud of such contemporaries."</p>
<p>Irma felt that the words applied to her as well. Her heart
throbbed. The plaster which stood before her suddenly seemed to
gaze at her with a strange expression.</p>
<p>"I should like to compare the finished work with the first
models," said the king to the artist.</p>
<p>"I regret that the experimental models are in my small atelier.
Does your Majesty wish me to have them brought here?"</p>
<p>"If you will be good enough to do so."</p>
<p>The master left. The King and Irma were alone. With rapid steps
the King mounted the ladder, and exclaimed in a tremulous
voice:--</p>
<p>"I ascend into heaven--I ascend to you. Irma, I kiss you, I kiss
your image, and may this kiss forever rest upon those lips,
enduring beyond all time. I kiss thee with the kiss of eternity."
He stood aloft and kissed the lips of the statue. Irma could not
help looking up, and just at that moment a slanting sunbeam fell on
the King and on the face of the marble figure, making it glow as if
with life.</p>
<p>Irma felt as if wrapped in a fiery cloud, bearing her away into
eternity.</p>
<p>The King descended and placed himself beside her. His breathing
was short and quick. She did not dare to look up; she stood as
silent and as immovable as a statue. Then the King embraced
her--and living lips kissed each other.</p>

<h3>THE NEW HOME AND THE OLD ONE</h3>
<center>From 'On the Heights'</center>
<p>Hansei received various offers for his cottage, and was always
provoked when it was spoken of as a 'tumble-down old shanty.' He
always looked as if he meant to say, "Don't take it ill of me, good
old house: the people only abuse you so that they may get you
cheap." Hansei stood his ground. He would not sell his home for a
penny less than it was worth; and besides that, he owned the
fishing-right, which was also worth something. Grubersepp at last
took the house off his hands, with the design of putting a servant
of his, who intended to marry in the fall, in possession of the
place.</p>
<p>All the villagers were kind and friendly to them,--doubly so
since they were about to leave,--and Hansei said:--</p>
<p>"It hurts me to think that I must leave a single enemy behind
me, I'd like to make it up with the innkeeper."</p>
<p>Walpurga agreed with him, and said that she would go along; that
she had really been the cause of the trouble, and that if the
innkeeper wanted to scold any one, he might as well scold her
too.</p>
<p>Hansei did not want his wife to go along, but she insisted upon
it.</p>
<p>It was in the last evening in August that they went up into the
village. Their hearts beat violently while they drew near to the
inn. There was no light in the room. They groped about the porch,
but not a soul was to be seen. Dachsel and Wachsel, however, were
making a heathenish racket. Hansei called out:</p>
<p>"Is there no one at home?"</p>
<p>"No. There's no one at home," answered a voice from the dark
room.</p>
<p>"Well, then tell the host, when he returns, that Hansei and his
wife were here, and that they came to ask him to forgive them if
they've done him any wrong; and to say that they forgive him too,
and wish him luck."</p>
<p>"A11 right: I'll tell him," said the voice. The door was again
slammed to, and Dachsel and Wachsel began barking again.</p>
<p>Hansei and Walpurga returned homeward.</p>
<p>"Do you know who that was?" asked Hansei.</p>
<p>"Why, yes: 'twas the innkeeper himself."</p>
<p>"Well, we've done all we could."</p>
<p>They found it sad to part from all the villagers. They listened
to the lovely tones of the bell which they had heard every hour
since childhood. Although their hearts were full, they did not say
a word about the sadness of parting. Hansei at last broke
silence:--"Our new home isn't out of the world: we can often come
here."</p>
<p>When they reached the cottage they found that nearly all of the
villagers had assembled in order to bid them farewell, but every
one added, "I'll see you again in the morning."</p>
<p>Grubersepp also came again. He had been proud enough before; but
now he was doubly so, for he had made a man of his neighbor, or at
all events had helped to do so. He did not give way to tender
sentiment. He condensed all his knowledge of life into a few
sentences, which he delivered himself of most bluntly.</p>
<p>"I only want to tell you," said he, "you'll have lots of
servants now. Take my word for it, the best of them are good for
nothing; but something may be made of them for all that. He who
would have his servants mow well, must take the scythe in hand
himself. And since you got your riches so quickly, don't forget the
proverb: 'Light come, light go.' Keep steady, or it'll go ill with
you."</p>
<p>He gave him much more good advice, and Hansei accompanied him
all the way back to his house. With a silent pressure of the hand
they took leave of each other.</p>
<p>The house seemed empty, for quite a number of chests and boxes
had been sent in advance by a boat that was already crossing the
lake. On the following morning two teams would be in waiting on the
other side.</p>
<p>"So this is the last time that we go to bed in this house," said
the mother. They were all fatigued with work and excitement, and
yet none of them cared to go to bed. At last, however, they could
not help doing so, although they slept but little.</p>
<p>The next morning they were up and about at an early hour. Having
attired themselves in their best clothes, they bundled up the beds
and carried them into the boat. The mother kindled the last fire on
the hearth. The cows were led out and put into the boat, the
chickens were also taken along in a coop, and the dog was
constantly running to and fro.</p>
<p>The hour of parting had come.</p>
<p>The mother uttered a prayer, and then called all of them into
the kitchen. She scooped up some water from the pail and poured it
into the fire, with these words:--"May all that's evil be thus
poured out and extinguished, and let those who light a fire after
us find nothing but health in their home."</p>
<p>Hansei, Walpurga, and Gundel were each of them obliged to pour a
ladleful of water into the fire, and the grandmother guided the
child's hand while it did the same thing.</p>
<p>After they had all silently performed this ceremony, the
grandmother prayed aloud:--</p>
<p>"Take from us, O Lord our God, all heartache and home-sickness
and all trouble, and grant us health and a happy home where we next
kindle our fire."</p>
<p>She was the first to cross the threshold. She had the child in
her arms and covered its eyes with her hands while she called out
to the others:--</p>
<p>"Don't look back when you go out."</p>
<p>"Just wait a moment," said Hansei to Walpurga when he found
himself alone with her. "Before we cross this threshold for the
last time, I've something to tell you. I must tell it. I mean to be
a righteous man and to keep nothing concealed from you. I must tell
you this, Walpurga. While you were away and Black Esther lived up
yonder, I once came very near being wicked--and unfaithful--thank
God, I wasn't. But it torments me to think that I ever wanted to be
bad; and now, Walpurga, forgive me and God will forgive me, too.
Now I've told you, and have nothing more to tell. If I were to
appear before God this moment, I'd know of nothing more."</p>
<p>Walpurga embraced him, and sobbing, said, "You're my dear good
husband!" and they crossed the threshold for the last time.</p>
<p>When they reached the garden, Hansei paused, looked up at the
cherry-tree, and said:--</p>
<p>"And so you remain here. Won't you come with us? We've always
been good friends, and spent many an hour together. But wait! I'll
take you with me, after all," cried he, joyfully, "and I'll plant
you in my new home."</p>
<p>He carefully dug out a shoot that was sprouting up from one of
the roots of the tree. He stuck it in his hat-band, and went to
join his wife at the boat.</p>
<p>From the landing-place on the bank were heard the merry sounds
of fiddles, clarinets, and trumpets.</p>
<p>Hansei hastened to the landing-place. The whole village had
congregated there, and with it the full band of music. Tailor
Schneck's son, he who had been one of, the cuirassiers at the
christening of the crown prince, had arranged and was now
conducting the parting ceremonies. Schneck, who was scraping his
bass-viol, was the first to see Hansei, and called out in the midst
of the music:--</p>
<p>"Long live farmer Hansei and the one he loves best! Hip, hip,
hurrah!"</p>
<p>The early dawn resounded with their cheers. There was a flourish
of trumpets, and the salutes fired from several small mortars were
echoed back from the mountains. The large boat in which their
household furniture, the two cows, and the fowls were placed, was
adorned with wreaths of fir and oak. Walpurga was standing in the
middle of the boat, and with both hands held the child aloft, so
that it might see the great crowd of friends and the lake sparkling
in the rosy dawn.</p>
<p>"My master's best respects," said one of Grubersepp's servants,
leading a snow-white colt by the halter: "he sends you this to
remember him by."</p>
<p>Grubersepp was not present. He disliked noise and crowds. He was
of a solitary and self-contained temperament. Nevertheless he sent
a present which was not only of intrinsic value, but was also a
most flattering souvenir; for a colt is usually given by a rich
farmer to a younger brother when about to depart. In the eyes of
all the world--that is to say, the whole village--Hansei appeared
as the younger brother of Grubersepp.</p>
<p>Little Burgei shouted for joy when she saw them leading the
snow-white foal into the boat. Gruberwaldl, who was but six years
old, stood by the whinnying colt, stroking it and speaking kindly
to it.</p>
<p>"Would you like to go to the farm with me and be my servant?"
asked Hansei of Gruberwaldl.</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed, if you'll take me."</p>
<p>"See what a boy he is," said Hansei to his wife. "What a
boy!"</p>
<p>Walpurga made no answer, but busied herself with the child.</p>
<p>Hansei shook hands with every one at parting. His hand trembled,
but he did not forget to give a couple of crown thalers to the
musicians.</p>
<p>At last he got into the boat and exclaimed:--</p>
<p>"Kind friends! I thank you all. Don't forget us, and we shan't
forget you. Farewell! may God protect you all."</p>
<p>Walpurga and her mother were in tears.</p>
<p>"And now, in God's name, let us start!" The chains were
loosened; the boat put off. Music, shouting, singing, and the
firing of cannon resounded while the boat quietly moved away from
the shore. The sun burst forth in all his glory.</p>
<p>The mother sat there, with her hands clasped. All were silent.
The only sound heard was the neighing of the foal.</p>
<p>Walpurga was the first to break the silence. "O dear Lord! if
people would only show each other half as much love during life as
they do when one dies or moves away."</p>
<p>The grandmother, who was in the middle of a prayer, shook her
head. She quickly finished her prayer and said:--</p>
<p>"That's more than one has the right to ask. It won't do to go
about all day long with your heart in your hand. But remember, I've
always told you that the people are good enough at heart, even if
there are a few bad ones among them."</p>
<p>Hansei bestowed an admiring glance upon his wife, who had so
many different thoughts about almost everything. He supposed it was
caused by her having been away from home. But his heart was full,
too, although in a different way.</p>
<p>"I can hardly realize," said Hansei, taking a long breath and
putting the pipe, which he had intended to light, back into his
pocket, "what has become of all the years that I spent there and
all that I went through during the time. Look, Walpurga! the road
you see there leads to my home. I know every hill and every hollow.
My mother's buried there. Do you see the pines growing on the hill
over yonder? That hill was quite bare; every tree was cut down when
the French were here; and see how fine and hardy the trees are now.
I planted most of them myself. I was a little boy about eleven or
twelve years old when the forester hired me. He had fresh soil
brought for the whole place and covered the rocky spots with moss.
In the spring I worked from six in the morning till seven in the
evening, putting in the little plants. My left hand was almost
frozen, for I had to keep putting it into a tub of wet loam, with
which I covered the roots. I was scantily clothed into the bargain,
and had nothing to eat all day long but a piece of bread. In the
morning it was cold enough to freeze the marrow in one's bones, and
at noon I was almost roasted by the hot sun beating on the rocks.
It was a hard life. Yes, I had a hard time of it when I was young.
Thank God, it hasn't harmed me any. But I shan't forget it; and
let's be right industrious and give all we can to the poor. I never
would have believed that I'd live to call a single tree or a
handful of earth my own; and now that God has given me so much,
let's try and deserve it all."</p>
<p>Hansei's eyes blinked, as if there was something in them, and he
pulled his hat down over his forehead. Now, while he was pulling
himself up by the roots as it were, he could not help thinking of
how thoroughly he had become engrafted into the neighborhood by the
work of his hands and by habit. He had felled many a tree, but he
knew full well how hard it was to remove the stumps.</p>
<p>The foal grew restive. Gruberwaldl, who had come with them in
order to hold it, was not strong enough, and one of the boatmen was
obliged to go to his assistance.</p>
<p>"Stay with the foal," said Hansei. "I'll take the oar."</p>
<p>"And I too," cried Walpurga. "Who knows when I'll have another
chance? Ah! how often I've rowed on the lake with you and my
blessed father."</p>
<p>Hansei and Walpurga sat side by side plying their oars in
perfect time. It did them both good to have some employment which
would enable them to work off the excitement.</p>
<p>"I shall miss the water," said Walpurga; "without the lake,
life'll seem so dull and dry. I felt that, while I was in the
city."</p>
<p>Hansei did not answer.</p>
<p>"At the summer palace there's a pond with swans swimming about
in it," said she, but still received no answer. She looked around,
and a feeling of anger arose within her. When she said anything at
the palace, it was always listened to.</p>
<p>In a sorrowful tone she added, "It would have been better if
we'd moved in the spring; it would have been much easier to get
used to things."</p>
<p>"Maybe it would," replied Hansei, at last, "but I've got to hew
wood in the winter. Walpurga, let's make life pleasant to each
other, and not sad. I shall have enough on my shoulders, and can't
have you and your palace thoughts besides."</p>
<p>Walpurga quickly answered, "I'll throw this ring, which the
Queen gave me, into the lake, to prove that I've stopped thinking
of the palace."</p>
<p>"There's no need of that. The ring's worth a nice sum, and
besides that it's an honorable keepsake. You must do just as I
do."</p>
<p>"Yes; only remain strong and true."</p>
<p>The grandmother suddenly stood up before them. Her features were
illumined with a strange expression, and she said:--</p>
<p>"Children! Hold fast to the good fortune that you have. You've
gone through fire and water together; for it was fire when you were
surrounded by joy and love and every one greeted you with
kindness--and you passed through the water, when the wickedness of
others stung you to the soul. At that time the water was up to your
neck, and yet you weren't drowned. Now you've got over it all. And
when my last hour comes, don't weep for me; for through you I've
enjoyed all the happiness a mother's heart can have in this
world."</p>
<p>She knelt down, scooped up some water with her hand, and
sprinkled it over Hansei's and also over Walpurga's face.</p>
<p>They rowed on in silence. The grandmother laid her head on a
roll of bedding and closed her eyes. Her face wore a strange
expression. After a while she opened her eyes again, and casting a
glance full of happiness on her children, she said:</p>
<p>"Sing and be merry. Sing the song that father and I so often
sang together; that one verse, the good one."</p>
<p>Hansei and Walpurga plied the oars while they sang:--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i7">"Ah, blissful is the tender tie</p>
<p class="i8">That binds me, love, to thee;</p>
<p class="i7">And swiftly speed the hours by,</p>
<p class="i8">When thou art near to me."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>They repeated the verse again, although at times the joyous
shouting of the child and the neighing of the foal bade fair to
interrupt it.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>As they drew near the house, they could hear the neighing of the
white foal.</p>
<p>"That's a good beginning," cried Hansei.</p>
<p>The grandmother placed the child on the ground, and got her
hymn-book out of the chest. Pressing the book against her breast
with both hands, she went into the house, being the first to enter.
Hansei, who was standing near the stable, took a piece of chalk
from his pocket and wrote the letters C.M.B., and the date, on the
stable door. Then he too went into the house,--his wife, Irma, and
the child following him.</p>
<p>Before going into the sitting-room the grandmother knocked
thrice at the door. When she had entered she placed the open
hymn-book upon the open window-sill, so that the sun might read in
it. There were no tables or chairs in the room.</p>
<p>Hansei shook hands with his wife and said, "God be with you,
freeholder's wife."</p>
<p>From that moment Walpurga was known as the "freeholder's wife,"
and was never called by any other name.</p>
<p>And now they showed Irma her room. The view extended over meadow
and brook and the neighboring forest. She examined the room. There
was naught but a green Dutch oven and bare walls, and she had
brought nothing with her. In her paternal mansion, and at the
castle, there were chairs and tables, horses and carriages; but
here--None of these follow the dead.</p>
<p>Irma knelt by the window and gazed out over meadow and forest,
where the sun was now shining.</p>
<p>How was it yesterday--was it only yesterday when you saw the sun
go down?</p>
<p>Her thoughts were confused and indistinct. She pressed her hand
to her forehead; the white handkerchief was still there. A bird
looked up to her from the meadow, and when her glance rested upon
it it flew away into the woods.</p>
<p>"The bird has its nest," said she to herself, "and I--"</p>
<p>Suddenly she drew herself up. Hansei had walked out to the grass
plot in front of Irma's window, removed the slip of the cherry-tree
from his hat, and planted it in the ground.</p>
<p>The grandmother stood by and said, "I trust that you'll be alive
and hearty long enough to climb this tree and gather cherries from
it, and that your children and grandchildren may do the same."</p>
<p>There was much to do and to set to rights in the house, and on
such occasions it usually happens that those who are dearest to one
another are as much in each other's way as closets and tables which
have not yet been placed where they belong. The best proof of the
amiability of these folks was that they assisted each other
cheerfully, and indeed with jest and song.</p>
<p>Walpurga moved her best furniture into Irma's room. Hansei did
not interpose a word. "Aren't you too lonely here?" asked Walpurga,
after she had arranged everything as well as possible in so short a
time.</p>
<p>"Not at all. There is no place in all the world lonely enough
for me. You've so much to do now; don't worry about me. I must now
arrange things within myself. I see how good you and yours are;
fate has directed me kindly."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't talk in that way. If you hadn't given me the money,
how could we have bought the farm? This is really your own."</p>
<p>"Don't speak of that," said Irma, with a sudden start. "Never
mention that money to me again."</p>
<p>Walpurga promised, and merely added that Irma needn't be alarmed
at the old man who lived in the room above hers, and who at times
would talk to himself and make a loud noise. He was old and blind.
The children teased and worried him, but he wasn't bad and would
harm no one. Walpurga offered at all events to leave Gundel with
Irma for the first night; but Irma preferred to be alone.</p>
<p>"You'll stay with us, won't you?" said Walpurga hesitatingly.
"You won't have such bad thoughts again?"</p>
<p>"No, never. But don't talk now: my voice pains me, and so does
yours too. Good-night! leave me alone."</p>
<p>Irma sat by the window and gazed out into the dark night. Was it
only a day since she had passed through such terrors? Suddenly she
sprang from her seat with a shudder. She had seen Black Esther's
head rising out of the darkness, had again heard her dying shriek,
had beheld the distorted face and the wild black tresses.--Her hair
stood on end. Her thoughts carried her to the bottom of the lake,
where she now lay dead. She opened the window and inhaled the soft,
balmy air. She sat by the open casement for a long while, and
suddenly heard some one laughing in the room above her.</p>
<p>"Ha! ha! I won't do you the favor! I won't die! I won't die!
Pooh, pooh! I'll live till I'm a hundred years old, and then I'll
get a new lease of life."</p>
<p>It was the old pensioner. After a while he continued:--</p>
<p>"I'm not so stupid; I know that it's night now, and the
freeholder and his wife are come. I'll give them lots of trouble.
I'm Jochem. Jochem's my name, and what the people don't like, I do
for spite. Ha! ha! I don't use any light, and they must make me an
allowance for that. I'll insist on it, if I have to go to the King
himself about it."</p>
<p>Irma started when she heard the King mentioned.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'll go to the King, to the King! to the King!" cried the
old man overhead, as if he knew that the word tortured Irma.</p>
<p>She heard him close the window and move a chair. The old man
went to bed.</p>
<p>Irma looked out into the dark night. Not a star was to be seen.
There was no light anywhere; nothing was heard but the roaring of
the mountain stream and the rustling of the trees. The night seemed
like a dark abyss.</p>
<p>"Are you still awake?" asked a soft voice without. It was the
grandmother.</p>
<p>"I was once a servant at this farm," said she. "That was forty
years ago; and now I'm the mother of the freeholder's wife, and
almost the head one on the farm. But I keep thinking of you all the
time. I keep trying to think how it is in your heart. I've
something to tell you. Come out again. I'll take you where it'll do
you good to be. Come!"</p>
<p>Irma went out into the dark night with the old woman. How
different this guide from the one she had had the day before!</p>
<p>The old woman led her to the fountain. She had brought a cup
with her and gave it to Irma. "Come, drink; good cold water's the
best. Water comforts the body; it cools and quiets us; it's like
bathing one's soul. I know what sorrow is too. One's insides burn
as if they were afire."</p>
<p>Irma drank some of the water of the mountain spring. It seemed
like a healing dew, whose influence was diffused through her whole
frame.</p>
<p>The grandmother led her back to her room and said, "You've still
got the shirt on that you wore at the palace. You'll never stop
thinking of that place till you've burned that shirt."</p>
<p>The old woman would listen to no denial, and Irma was as docile
as a little child. The grandmother hurried to get a coarse shirt
for her, and after Irma had put it on, brought wood and a light and
burnt the other at the open fire. Irma was also obliged to cut off
her long nails and throw them into the fire. Then Beate disappeared
for a few moments, and returned with Irma's riding-habit. "You must
have been shot; for there are balls in this," said she, spreading
out the long blue habit.</p>
<p>A smile passed over Irma's face, as she felt the balls that had
been sewed into the lower part of the habit, so that it might hang
more gracefully. Beate had also brought something very useful,--a
deerskin. "Hansei sends you this," said she. "He thinks that maybe
you're used to having something soft for your feet to rest on. He
shot the deer himself."</p>
<p>Irma appreciated the kindness of the man who could show such
affection to one who was both a stranger and a mystery to him.</p>
<p>The grandmother remained at Irma's bedside until she fell
asleep. Then she breathed thrice on the sleeper and left the
room.</p>
<p>It was late at night when Irma awoke.</p>
<p>"To the King! to the King! to the King!" The words had been
uttered thrice in a loud voice. Was it hers, or that of the man
overhead? Irma pressed her hand to her forehead and felt the
bandage. Was it sea-grass that had gathered there? Was she lying
alive at the bottom of the lake? Gradually all that had happened
became clear to her.</p>
<p>Alone, in the dark and silent night, she wept. And these were
the first tears she had shed since the terrible events through
which she had passed.</p>
<p>It was evening when Irma awoke. She put her hand to her
forehead. A wet cloth had been bound round it. She had been
sleeping nearly twenty-four hours. The grandmother was sitting by
her bed.</p>
<p>"You've a strong constitution," said the old woman, "and that
helped you. It's all right now."</p>
<p>Irma arose. She felt strong, and guided by the grandmother,
walked over to the dwelling-house.</p>
<p>"God be praised that you're well again," said Walpurga, who was
standing there with her husband; and Hansei added, "yes, that's
right."</p>
<p>Irma thanked them, and looked up at the gable of the house. What
words there met her eye?</p>
<p>"Don't you think the house has a good motto written on its
forehead?" asked Hansei.</p>
<p>Irma started. On the gable of the house she read the following
inscription:--</p>
<br>
<br>
<center>EAT AND DRINK: FORGET NOT GOD: THINE HONOR GUARD:<br>
OF ALL THY STORE,<br>
THOU'LT CARRY HENCE<br>
A WINDING-SHEET<br>
AND NOTHING MORE.</center>

<h3>THE COURT PHYSICIAN'S PHILOSOPHY</h3>
<center>From 'On the Heights'</center>
<p>Gunther continued, "I am only a physician, who has held many a
hand hot with fever or stiff in death in his own. The healing art
might serve as an illustration. We help all who need our help, and
do not stop to ask who they are, whence they come, or whether when
restored to health they persist in their evil courses. Our actions
are incomplete, fragmentary; thought alone is complete and
all-embracing. Our deeds and ourselves are but fragments--the whole
is God."</p>
<p>"I think I grasp your meaning [replied the Queen]. But our life,
as you say, is indeed a mere fraction of life as a whole; and how
is each one to bear up under the portion of suffering that falls to
his individual lot? Can one--I mean it in its best sense--always be
outside of one's self?"</p>
<p>"I am well aware, your Majesty, that passions and emotions
cannot be regulated by ideas; for they grow in a different soil,
or, to express myself correctly, move in entirely different
spheres. It is but a few days since I closed the eyes of my old
friend Eberhard. Even he never fully succeeded in subordinating his
temperament to his philosophy; but in his dying hour he rose beyond
the terrible grief that broke his heart--grief for his child. He
summoned the thoughts of better hours to his aid,--hours when his
perception of the truth had been undimmed by sorrow or
passion,--and he died a noble, peaceful death. Your Majesty must
still live and labor, elevating yourself and others, at one and the
same time. Permit me to remind you of the moment when, seated under
the weeping ash, your heart was filled with pity for the poor child
that from the time it enters into the world is doubly helpless. Do
you still remember how you refused to rob it of its mother? I
appeal to the pure and genuine impulse of that moment. You were
noble and forgiving then, because you had not yet suffered. You
cast no stone at the fallen; you loved, and therefore you
forgave."</p>
<p>"O God!" cried the Queen, "and what has happened to me? The
woman on whose bosom my child rested is the most abandoned of
creatures. I loved her just as if she belonged to another world--a
world of innocence. And now I am satisfied that she was the
go-between, and that her na&iuml;vet&eacute; was a mere mask
concealing an unparalleled hypocrite. I imagined that truth and
purity still dwelt in the simple rustic world--but everything is
perverted and corrupt. The world of simplicity is base; aye, far
worse than that of corruption!"</p>
<p>"I am not arguing about individuals. I think you mistaken in
regard to Walpurga; but admitting that you are right, of this at
least we can be sure: morality does not depend upon so-called
education or ignorance, belief or unbelief. The heart and mind
which have regained purity and steadfastness alone possess true
knowledge. Extend your view beyond details and take in the
whole--that alone can comfort and reconcile you."</p>
<p>"I see where you are, but I cannot get up there. I can't always
be looking through your telescope that shows naught but blue sky. I
am too weak. I know what you mean; you say in effect, 'Rise above
these few people, above this span of space known as a kingdom:
compared with the universe, they are but as so many blades of grass
or a mere clod of earth.'"</p>
<p>Gunther nodded a pleased assent: but the Queen, in a sad voice,
added:--</p>
<p>"Yes, but this space and these people constitute my world. Is
purity merely imaginary? If it be not about us, where can it be
found?"</p>
<p>"Within ourselves," replied Gunther. "If it dwell within us, it
is everywhere; if not, it is nowhere. He who asks for more has not
yet passed the threshold. His heart is not yet what it should be.
True love for the things of this earth, and for God, the final
cause of all, does not ask for love in return. We love the divine
spark that dwells in creatures themselves unconscious of it:
creatures who are wretched, debased, and as the church has it,
unredeemed. My Master taught me that the purest joys arise from
this love of God or of eternally pure nature. I made this truth my
own, and you can and ought to do likewise. This park is yours; but
the birds that dwell in it, the air, the light, its beauty, are not
yours alone, but are shared with you by all. So long as the world
is ours, in the vulgar sense of the word, we may love it; but when
we have made it our own, in a purer and better sense, no one can
take it from us. The great thing is to be strong and to know that
hatred is death, that love alone is life, and that the amount of
love that we possess is the measure of the life and the divinity
that dwells within us."</p>
<p>Gunther rose and was about to withdraw. He feared lest excessive
thought might over-agitate the Queen, who, however, motioned him to
remain. He sat down again.</p>
<p>"You cannot imagine--" said the Queen after a long pause, "--but
that is one of the cant phrases that we have learned by heart. I
mean just the reverse of what I have said. You can imagine the
change that your words have effected in me."</p>
<p>"I can conceive it."</p>
<p>"Let me ask a few more questions. I believe--nay, I am
sure--that on the height you occupy, and toward which you would
fain lead me, there dwells eternal peace. But it seems so cold and
lonely up there. I am oppressed with a sense of fear, just as if I
were in a balloon ascending into a rarer atmosphere, while more and
more ballast was ever being thrown out. I don't know how to make my
meaning clear to you. I don't understand how to keep up
affectionate relations with those about me, and yet regard them
from a distance, as it were,--looking upon their deeds as the mere
action and reaction of natural forces. It seems to me as if, at
that height, every sound and every image must vanish into thin
air."</p>
<p>"Certainly, your Majesty. There is a realm of thought in which
hearing and sight do not exist, where there is pure thought and
nothing more."</p>
<p>"But are not the thoughts that there abound projected from the
realm of death into that of life, and is that any better than
monastic self-mortification?"</p>
<p>"It is just the contrary. They praise death, or at all events
extol it, because after it life is to begin. I am not one of those
who deny a future life. I only say, in the words of my Master, 'Our
knowledge is of life and not of death,' and where my knowledge
ceases my thoughts must cease. Our labors, our love, are all of
this life. And because God is in this world and in all that exist
in it, and only in those things, have we to liberate the divine
essence wherever it exists. The law of love should rule. What the
law of nature is in regard to matter, the moral law is to man."</p>
<p>"I cannot reconcile myself to your dividing the divine power
into millions of parts. When a stone is crushed, every fragment
still remains a stone; but when a flower is torn to pieces, the
parts are no longer flowers."</p>
<p>"Let us take your simile as an illustration, although in truth
no example is adequate. The world, the firmament, the creatures
that live on the face of the earth, are not divided--they are one;
thought regards them as a whole. Take for instance the flower. The
idea of divinity which it suggests to us, and the fragrance which
ascends from it, are yet part and parcel of the flower; attributes
without which it is impossible for us to conceive of its existence.
The works of all poets, all thinkers, all heroes, may be likened to
streams of fragrance wafted through time and space. It is in the
flower that they live forever. Although the eternal spirit dwells
in the cell of every tree or flower and in every human heart, it is
undivided and in its unity fills the world. He whose thoughts dwell
in the infinite regards the world as the mighty corolla from which
the thought of God exhales."</p>

<h3>IN COUNTESS IRMA'S DIARY</h3>
<center>From 'On the Heights'</center>
<p>Yesterday was a year since I lay at the foot of the rock. I
could not write a word. My brain whirled with the thoughts of that
day; but now it is over.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>I don't think I shall write much more. I have now experienced
all the seasons in my new world. The circle is complete. There is
nothing new to come from without. I know all that exists about me,
or that can happen. I am at home in my new world.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>Unto Jesus the Scribes and Pharisees brought a woman who was to
be stoned to death, and He said unto them, "Let him that is without
sin among you cast the first stone."</p>
<p>Thus it is written.</p>
<p>But I ask: How did she continue to live--she who was saved from
being stoned to death; she who was pardoned--that is, condemned to
live? How did she live on? Did she return to her home? How did she
stand with the world? And how with her own heart?</p>
<p>No answer. None.</p>
<p>I must find the answer in my own experience</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>"Let him that is without sin among you cast the first stone."
These are the noblest, the greatest words ever uttered by human
lips, or heard by human ear. They divide the history of the human
race into two parts. They are the "Let there be light" of the
second creation. They divide and heal my little life too, and
create me anew.</p>
<p>Has one who is not wholly without sin a right to offer precepts
and reflections to others?</p>
<p>Look into your own heart. What are you?</p>
<p>Behold my hands. They are hardened by toil. I have done more
than merely lift them in prayer.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>Since I am alone I have not seen a letter of print. I have no
book and wish for none; and this is not in order to mortify myself,
but because I wish to be perfectly alone.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>She who renounces the world, and in her loneliness still
cherishes the thought of eternity, has assumed a heavy burden.</p>
<p>Convent life is not without its advantages. The different voices
that join in the <i>chorale</i> sustain each other; and when the
tone at last ceases, it seems to float away on the air and vanish
by degrees. But here I am quite alone. I am priest and church,
organ and congregation, confessor and penitent, all in one; and my
heart is often <i>so</i> heavy, as if I must needs have another to
help me bear the load. "Take me up and carry me, I cannot go
further!" cries my soul. But then I rouse myself again, seize my
scrip and my pilgrim's staff and wander on, solitary and alone; and
while I wander, strength returns to me.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>It often seems to me as if it were sinful thus to bury myself
alive. My voice is no longer heard in song, and much more that
dwells within me has become mute.</p>
<p>Is this right?</p>
<p>If my only object in life were to be at peace with myself, it
would be well enough; but I long to labor and to do something for
others. Yet where and what shall it be?</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>When I first heard that the beautifully carved furniture of the
great and wealthy is the work of prisoners, it made me shudder. And
now, although I am not deprived of freedom, I am in much the same
condition. Those who have disfigured life should, as an act of
expiation, help to make life more beautiful for others. The thought
that I am doing this comforts and sustains me.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>My work prospers. But last winter's wood is not yet fit for use.
My little pitchman has brought me some that is old, excellent, and
well seasoned, having been part of the rafters of an old house that
has just been torn down. We work together cheerfully, and our
earnings are considerable.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>Vice is the same everywhere, except that here it is more open.
Among the masses, vice is characterized by coarseness; among the
upper classes, by meanness.</p>
<p>The latter shake off the consequences of their evil deeds, while
the former are obliged to bear them.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>The rude manners of these people are necessary, and are far
preferable to polite deceit. They must needs be rough and rude. If
it were not for its coarse, thick bark, the oak could not withstand
the storm.</p>
<p>I have found that this rough bark covers more tenderness and
sincerity than does the smoothest surface.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>Jochem told me, to-day, that he is still quite a good walker,
but that a blind man finds it very troublesome to go anywhere; for
at every step he is obliged to grope about, so that he may feel
sure of his ground before he firmly plants his foot on the
earth.</p>
<p>Is it not the same with me? Am I not obliged to be sure of the
ground before I take a step?</p>
<p>Such is the way of the fallen.</p>
<p>Ah! why does everything I see or hear become a symbol of my
life?</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>I have now been here between two and three years. I have formed
a resolve which it will be difficult to carry out. I shall go out
into the world once more. I must again behold the scenes of my past
life. I have tested myself severely.</p>
<p>May it not be a love of adventure, that genteel yet vulgar
desire to undertake what is unusual or fraught with peril? Or is it
a morbid desire to wander through the world after having died, as
it were?</p>
<p>No; far from it. What can it be? An intense longing to roam
again, if it be only for a few days. I must kill the desire, lest
it kill me.</p>
<p>Whence arises this sudden longing?</p>
<p>Every tool that I use while at work burns my hand.</p>
<p>I must go.</p>
<p>I shall obey the impulse, without worrying myself with
speculations as to its cause. I am subject to the rules of no
order. My will is my only law. I harm no one by obeying it. I feel
myself free; the world has no power over me.</p>
<p>I dreaded informing Walpurga of my intention. When I did so, her
tone, her words, her whole manner, and the fact that she for the
first time called me "child," made it seem as if her mother were
still speaking to me.</p>
<p>"Child," said she, "you're right! Go! It'll do you good. I
believe that you'll come back and will stay with us; but if you
don't, and another life opens up to you--your expiation has been a
bitter one, far heavier than your sin."</p>
<p>Uncle Peter was quite happy when he learned that we were to be
gone from one Sunday to the Sunday following. When I asked him
whether he was curious as to where we were going, he replied:--</p>
<p>"It's all one to me. I'd travel over the whole world with you,
wherever you'd care to go; and if you were to drive me away, I'd
follow you like a dog and find you again."</p>
<p>I shall take my journal with me, and will note down every
day.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>[By the lake.]--I find it difficult to write a word.</p>
<p>The threshold I am obliged to cross, in order to go out into the
world, is my own gravestone.</p>
<p>I am equal to it.</p>
<p>How pleasant it was to descend toward the valley. Uncle Peter
sang; and melodies suggested themselves to me, but I did not sing.
Suddenly he interrupted himself and said:--</p>
<p>"In the inns you'll be my niece, won't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"But you must call me 'uncle' when we're there?"</p>
<p>"Of course, dear uncle."</p>
<p>He kept nodding to himself for the rest of the way, and was
quite happy.</p>
<p>We reached the inn at the landing. He drank, and I drank too,
from the same glass.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" asked the hostess.</p>
<p>"To the capital," said he, although I had not said a word to him
about it. Then he said to me in a whisper:--</p>
<p>"If you intend to go elsewhere, the people needn't know
everything."</p>
<p>I let him have his own way.</p>
<p>I looked for the place where I had wandered at that time.
There--there was the rock--and on it a cross, bearing in golden
characters the inscription:--</p>
<center>HERE PERISHED<br>
<br>
IRMA, COUNTESS VON WILDENORT,<br>
<br>
IN THE TWENTY-FIRST YEAR<br>
OF HER LIFE.<br>
<br>
<i>Traveler, pray for her and honor her memory</i>.</center>
<br>
<p>I never rightly knew why I was always dissatisfied, and yearning
for the next hour, the next day, the next year, hoping that it
would bring me that which I could not find in the present. It was
not love, for love does not satisfy. I desired to live in the
passing moment, but could not. It always seemed as if something
were waiting for me without the door, and calling me. What could it
have been?</p>
<p>I know now; it was a desire to be at one with myself, to
understand myself. Myself in the world, and the world in me.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>The vain man is the loneliest of human beings. He is constantly
longing to be seen, understood, acknowledged, admired, and
loved.</p>
<p>I could say much on the subject, for I too was once vain. It was
only in actual solitude that I conquered the loneliness of vanity.
It is enough for me that I exist.</p>
<p>How far removed this is from all that is mere show.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>Now I understand my father's last act. He did not mean to punish
me. His only desire was to arouse me; to lead me to
self-consciousness; to the knowledge which, teaching us to become
different from what we are, saves us.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>I understand the inscription in my father's library:--"When I am
alone, then am I least alone."</p>
<p>Yes; when alone, one can more perfectly lose himself in the life
universal. I have lived and have come to know the truth. I can now
die.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>He who is at one with himself, possesses all....</p>
<p>I believe that I know what I have done. I have no compassion for
myself. This is my full confession.</p>
<p>I have sinned--not against nature, but against the world's
rules. Is that sin? Look at the tall pines in yonder forest. The
higher the tree grows, the more do the lower branches die away; and
thus the tree in the thick forest is protected and sheltered by its
fellows, but can nevertheless not perfect itself in all
directions.</p>
<p>I desired to lead a full and complete life and yet to be in the
forest, to be in the world and yet in society. But he who means to
live thus, must remain in solitude. As soon as we become members of
society, we cease to be mere creatures of nature. Nature and
morality have equal rights, and must form a compact with each
other; and where there are two powers with equal rights, there must
be mutual concessions.</p>
<p>Herein lies my sin.</p>
<p><i>He who desires to live a life of nature alone, must withdraw
himself from the protection of morality. I did not fully desire
either the one or the other; hence I was crushed and
shattered</i>.</p>
<p>My father's last action was right. He avenged the moral law,
which is just as human as the law of nature. The animal world knows
neither father nor mother, so soon as the young is able to take
care of itself. The human world does know them and must hold them
sacred.</p>
<p>I see it all quite clearly. My sufferings and my expiation are
deserved. I was a thief! I stole the highest treasures of all:
confidence, love, honor, respect, splendor.</p>
<p>How noble and exalted the tender souls appear to themselves when
a poor rogue is sent to jail for having committed a theft! But what
are all possessions which can be carried away, when compared with
those that are intangible!</p>
<p>Those who are summoned to the bar of justice are not always the
basest of mankind.</p>
<p>I acknowledge my sin, and my repentance is sincere.</p>
<p>My fatal sin, the sin for which I now atone, was that I
dissembled, that I denied and extenuated that which I represented
to myself as a natural right. Against the Queen I have sinned worst
of all. To me she represents that moral order which I violated and
yet wished to enjoy.</p>
<p>To you, O Queen, to you--lovely, good, and deeply injured
one--do I confess all this!</p>
<p>If I die before you,--and I hope that I may,--these pages are to
be given to you.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>I can now accurately tell the season of the year, and often the
hour of the day, by the way in which the first sunbeams fall into
my room and on my work-bench in the morning. My chisel hangs before
me on the wall, and is my index.</p>
<p>The drizzling spring showers now fall on the trees; and thus it
is with me. It seems as if there were a new delight in store for
me. What can it be? I shall patiently wait!</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>A strange feeling comes over me, as if I were lifted up from the
chair on which I am sitting, and were flying, I know not whither!
What is it? I feel as if dwelling in eternity.</p>
<p>Everything seems flying toward me: the sunlight and the
sunshine, the rustling of the forests and the forest breezes,
beings of all ages and of all kinds--all seem beautiful and
rendered transparent by the sun's glow.</p>
<p>I am!</p>
<p>I am in God!</p>
<p>If I could only die now and be wafted through this joy to
dissolution and redemption!</p>
<p>But I will live on until my hour comes.</p>
<p>Come, thou dark hour, whenever thou wilt! To me thou art
light!</p>
<p>I feel that there is light within me. O Eternal Spirit of the
universe, I am one with thee!</p>
<p>I was dead, and I live--I shall die and yet live.</p>
<p>Everything has been forgiven and blotted out.--There was dust on
my wings.--I soar aloft into the sun and into infinite space. I
shall die singing from the fullness of my soul. Shall I sing!</p>
<p>Enough.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>I know that I shall again be gloomy and depressed and drag along
a weary existence; but I have once soared into infinity and have
felt a ray of eternity within me. That I shall never lose again. I
should like to go to a convent, to some quiet, cloistered cell,
where I might know nothing of the world, and could live on within
myself until death shall call me. But it is not to be. I am
destined to live on in freedom and to labor; to live with my
fellow-beings and to work for them.</p>
<p>The results of my handiwork and of my powers of imagination
belong to you; but what I am within myself is mine alone.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>I have taken leave of everything here; of my quiet room, of my
summer bench; for I know not whether I shall ever return. And if I
do, who knows but what everything may have become strange to
me?</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>(Last page written in pencil.)--It is my wish that when I am
dead, I may be wrapped in a simple linen cloth, placed in a rough
unplaned coffin, and buried under the apple-tree, on the road that
leads to my paternal mansion. I desire that my brother and other
relatives may be apprised of my death at once, and that they shall
not disturb my grave by the wayside.</p>
<p>No stone, no name, is to mark my grave.</p>

<h2>&Eacute;MILE <a name="AUGIER"></a>AUGIER</h2>
<h3>(1820-1889)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-a.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>s an observer of society, a satirist, and a painter of types and
characters of modern life, &Eacute;mile Augier ranks among the
greatest French dramatists of this century. Critics consider him in
the line of direct descent from Moli&egrave;re and Beaumarchais.
His collected works ('Theatre Complet') number twenty-seven plays,
of which nine are in verse. Eight of these were written with a
literary partner. Three are now called classics: 'Le Gendre de M.
Poirier' (M. Poirier's Son-in-Law), 'L'Aventuri&egrave;re' (The
Adventuress), and 'Fils de Giboyer' (Giboyer's Boy). 'Le Gendre de
M. Poirier' was written with Jules Sandeau, but the admirers of
Augier have proved by internal evidence that his share in its
composition was the greater. It is a comedy of manners based on the
old antagonism between vulgar ignorant energy and ability on the
one side, and lazy empty birth and breeding on the other; embodied
in Poirier, a wealthy shopkeeper, and M. de Presles, his
son-in-law, an impoverished nobleman. Guillaume Victor &Eacute;mile
Augier was born in Valence, France, September 17th, 1820, and was
intended for the law; but inheriting literary tastes from his
grandfather, Pigault Lebrun the romance writer, he devoted himself
to letters. When his first play, 'La Cigu&euml;' (The Hemlock),--in
the preface to which he defended his grandfather's memory,--was
presented at the Od&eacute;on in 1844, it made the author famous.
Th&eacute;ophile Gautier describes it at length in Vol. iii. of his
'Art Dramatique,' and compares it to Shakespeare's 'Timon of
Athens.' It is a classic play, and the hero closes his career by a
draught of hemlock.</p>
<p>Augier's works are:--'Un Homme de Bien' (A Good Man);
'L'Aventuri&egrave;re' (The Adventuress); 'Gabrielle'; 'Le Joueur
de Flute' (The Flute Player); 'Diane' (Diana), a romantic play on
the same theme as Victor Hugo's 'Marion Delorme,' written for and
played by Rachel; 'La Pierre de Touche' (The Touchstone), with
Jules Sandeau; 'Philberte,' a comedy of the last century; 'Le
Mariage d'Olympe' (Olympia's Marriage); 'Le Gendre de M. Poirier'
(M. Poirier's Son-in-Law); 'Ceinture Dor&eacute;e' (The Golden
Belt), with Edouard Foussier; 'La Jeunesse' (Youth); 'Les Lionnes
Pauvres' (Ambition and Poverty),--a bold story of social life in
Paris during the Second Empire, also with Foussier; 'Les
Effront&eacute;s' (Brass), an attack on the worship of money; 'Le
Fils de Giboyer' (Giboyer's Boy), the story of a father's devotion,
ambitions, and self-sacrifice; 'Ma&icirc;tre Gu&eacute;rin'
(Gu&eacute;rin the Notary), the hero being an inventor; 'La
Contagion' (Contagion), the theme of which is skepticism; 'Paul
Forestier,' the story of a young artist; 'Le Post-Scriptum' (The
Postscript); 'Lions et Renards' (Lions and Foxes), whose motive is
love of power; 'Jean Thommeray,' the hero of which is drawn from
Sandeau's novel of the same title; 'Madame Caverlet,' hinging on
the divorce question; 'Les Fourchambault' (The Fourchambaults), a
plea for family union; 'La Chasse au Roman' (Pursuit of a Romance),
and 'L'Habit Vert' (The Green Coat), with Sandeau and Alfred de
Musset; and the libretto for Gounod's opera 'Sappho.' Augier wrote
one volume of verse, which he modestly called 'Pari&eacute;taire,'
the name of a common little vine, the English danewort. In 1858 he
was elected to the French Academy, and in 1868 became a Commander
of the Legion of Honor. He died at Croissy, October 25th, 1889. An
analysis of his dramas by &Eacute;mile Mont&eacute;gut is published
in the Revue de Deux Mondes for April, 1878.</p>

<h3>A CONVERSATION WITH A PURPOSE</h3>
<center>From 'Giboyer's Boy'</center>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--Well, dear Baroness, what has an old bachelor
like me done to deserve so charming a visit?</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--That's what I wonder myself, Marquis. Now I see
you I don't know why I've come, and I've a great mind to go
straight back.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--Sit down, vexatious one!</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--No. So you close your door for a week; your
servants all look tragic; your friends put on mourning in
anticipation; I, disconsolate, come to inquire--and behold, I find
you at table!</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--I'm an old flirt, and wouldn't show myself for
an empire when I'm in a bad temper. You wouldn't recognize your
agreeable friend when he has the gout;--that's why I hide.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--I shall rush off to reassure your friend.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--They are not so anxious as all that. Tell me
something of them.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--But somebody's waiting in my carriage.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--I'll send to ask him up.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--But I'm not sure that you know him.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--His name?</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--I met him by chance.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--And you brought him by chance. [<i>He
rings</i>.] You are a mother to me. [<i>To Dubois</i>.] You will
find an ecclesiastic in Madame's carriage. Tell him I'm much
obliged for his kind alacrity, but I think I won't die this
morning.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--O Marquis! what would our friends say if they
heard you?</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--Bah! I'm the black sheep of the party, its
spoiled child; that's taken for granted. Dubois, you may say also
that Madame begs the Abb&eacute; to drive home, and to send her
carriage back for her.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--Allow me--</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--Go along, Dubois.--Now you are my prisoner.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--But, Marquis, this is very unconventional.</p>
<p><i>Marquis [kissing her hand</i>]--Flatterer! Now sit down, and
let's talk about serious things. <i>[Taking a newspaper from the
table</i>.] The gout hasn't kept me from reading the news. Do you
know that poor D&eacute;odat's death is a serious mishap?</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--What a loss to our cause!</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--I have wept for him.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--Such talent! Such spirit! Such sarcasm!</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--He was the hussar of orthodoxy. He will live in
history as the angelic pamphleteer. And now that we have settled
his noble ghost--</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--You speak very lightly about it, Marquis.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--I tell you I've wept for him.--Now let's think
of some one to replace him.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--Say to succeed him. Heaven doesn't create two
such men at the same time.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--What if I tell you that I have found such
another? Yes, Baroness, I've unearthed a wicked, cynical, virulent
pen, that spits and splashes; a fellow who would lard his own
father with epigrams for a consideration, and who would eat him
with salt for five francs more.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--D&eacute;odat had sincere convictions.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--That's because he fought for them. There are no
more mercenaries. The blows they get convince them. I'll give this
fellow a week to belong to us body and soul.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--If you haven't any other proofs of his
faithfulness--</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--But I have.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--Where from?</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--Never mind. I have it.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--And why do you wait before presenting him?</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--For him in the first place, and then for his
consent. He lives in Lyons, and I expect him to-day or to-morrow.
As soon as he is presentable, I'll introduce him.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--Meanwhile, I'll tell the committee of your
find.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--I beg you, no. With regard to the committee,
dear Baroness, I wish you'd use your influence in a matter which
touches me.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--I have not much influence--</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--Is that modesty, or the exordium of a
refusal?</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--If either, it's modesty.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--Very well, my charming friend. Don't you know
that these gentlemen owe you too much to refuse you anything?</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--Because they meet in my parlor?</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--That, yes; but the true, great, inestimable
service you render every day is to possess such superb eyes.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--It's well for you to pay attention to such
things!</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--Well for me, but better for these Solons whose
compliments don't exceed a certain romantic intensity.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--You are dreaming.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--What I say is true. That's why serious societies
always rally in the parlor of a woman, sometimes clever, sometimes
beautiful. You are both, Madame: judge then of your power!</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--You are too complimentary: your cause must be
detestable.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--If it was good I could win it for myself.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--Come, tell me, tell me.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--Well, then: we must choose an orator to the
Chamber for our Campaign against the University. I want them to
choose--</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--Monsieur Mar&eacute;chal?</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--You are right.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--Do you really think so, Marquis? Monsieur
Mar&eacute;chal?</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--Yes, I know. But we don't need a bolt of
eloquence, since we'll furnish the address. Mar&eacute;chal reads
well enough, I assure you.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--We made him deputy on your recommendation. That
was a good deal.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--Mar&eacute;chal is an excellent recruit.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--So you say.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--How disgusted you are! An old subscriber to the
Constitutionnel, a liberal, a Voltairean, who comes over to the
enemy bag and baggage. What would you have? Monsieur
Mar&eacute;chal is not a man, my dear: it's the stout
<i>bourgeoisie</i> itself coming over to us. I love this honest
<i>bourgeoisie</i>, which hates the revolution, since there is no
more to be gotten out of it; which wants to stem the tide which
brought it, and make over a little feudal France to its own profit.
Let it draw our chestnuts from the fire if it wants to. This
pleasant sight makes me enjoy politics. Long live Monsieur
Mar&eacute;chal and his likes, <i>bourgeois</i> of the right
divine. Let us heap these precious allies with honor and glory
until our triumph ships them off to their mills again.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--Several of our deputies are birds of the same
feather. Why choose the least capable for orator?</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--It's not a question of capacity.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--You're a warm patron of Monsieur
Mar&eacute;chal!</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--I regard him as a kind of family
prot&eacute;g&eacute;. His grandfather was farmer to mine. I'm his
daughter's guardian. These are bonds.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--You don't tell everything.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--All that I know.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--Then let me complete your information. They say
that in old times you fell in love with the first Madame
Mar&eacute;chal.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--I hope you don't believe this silly story?</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--Faith, you do so much to please Monsieur
Mar&eacute;chal--</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--That it seems as if I must have injured him?
Good heavens! Who is safe from malice? Nobody. Not even you, dear
Baroness.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--I'd like to know what they can say of me.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--Foolish things that I certainly won't
repeat.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--Then you believe them?</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--God forbid! That your dead husband married his
mother's companion? It made me so angry!</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--Too much honor for such wretched gossip.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--I answered strongly enough, I can tell you.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--I don't doubt it.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--But you are right in wanting to marry again.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--Who says I want to?</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--Ah! you don't treat me as a friend. I deserve
your confidence all the more for understanding you as if you had
given it. The aid of a sorcerer is not to be despised,
Baroness.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i> [<i>sitting down by the table</i>]--Prove your
sorcery.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i> [<i>sitting down opposite</i>]--Willingly! Give
me your hand.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i> [<i>removing her glove</i>]--You'll give it back
again.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--And help you dispose of it, which is more.
[<i>Examining her hand</i>.] You are beautiful, rich, and a
widow.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--I could believe myself at Mademoiselle
Lenormand's!</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--While it is so easy, not to say tempting, for
you to lead a brilliant, frivolous life, you have chosen a
r&ocirc;le almost austere with its irreproachable morals.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--If it was a r&ocirc;le, you'll admit that it
was much like a penitence.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--Not for you.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--What do you know about it?</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--I read it in your hand. I even see that the
contrary would cost you more, for nature has gifted your heart with
unalterable calmness.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i> [<i>drawing away her hand</i>]--Say at once that
I'm a monster.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--Time enough! The credulous think you a saint;
the skeptics say you desire power; I, Guy Fran&ccedil;ois
Condorier, Marquis d'Auberive, think you a clever little German,
trying to build a throne for yourself in the Faubourg
Saint-Germain. You have conquered the men, but the women resist
you: your reputation offends them; and for want of a better weapon
they use this miserable rumor I've just repeated. In short, your
flag's inadequate and you're looking for a larger one. Henry IV.
said that Paris was worth a mass. You think so too.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--They say sleep-walkers shouldn't be
contradicted. However, do let me say that if I really wanted a
husband--with my money and my social position, I might already have
found twenty.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--Twenty, yes; but not one. You forget this little
devil of a rumor.</p>
<p><i>Baroness [rising]</i>--Only fools believe that.</p>
<p><i>Marquis [rising]</i>--There's the <i>hic</i>. It's only very
clever men, too clever, who court you, and you want a fool.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--Why?</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--Because you don't want a master. You want a
husband whom you can keep in your parlor, like a family portrait,
nothing more.</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--Have you finished, dear diviner? What you have
just said lacks common-sense, but you are amusing, and I can refuse
you nothing.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--Mar&eacute;chal shall have the oration?</p>
<p><i>Baroness</i>--Or I'll lose my name.</p>
<p><i>Marquis</i>--And you <i>shall</i> lose your name--I promise
you.</p>

<h3>A SEVERE YOUNG JUDGE</h3>
<center>From 'The Adventuress'</center>
<p><i>Clorinde</i> [<i>softly</i>]--Here's C&eacute;lie. Look at
her clear eyes. I love her, innocent child!</p>
<p><i>Annibal</i>--Yes, yes, yes! [<i>He sits down in a
corner.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Clorinde</i> [<i>approaching C&eacute;lie, who has paused in
the doorway</i>]--My child, you would not avoid me to-day if you
knew how happy you make me!</p>
<p><i>C&eacute;lie</i>--My father has ordered me to come to
you.</p>
<p><i>Clorinde</i>--Ordered you? Did you need an order? Are we
really on such terms? Tell me, do you think I do not love you, that
you should look upon me as your enemy? Dear, if you could read my
heart you would find there the tenderest attachment.</p>
<p><i>C&eacute;lie</i>--I do not know whether you are sincere,
Madame. I hope that you are not, for it distresses one to be loved
by those--</p>
<p><i>Clorinde</i>--Whom one does not love? They must have painted
me black indeed, that you are so reluctant to believe in my
friendship.</p>
<p><i>C&eacute;lie</i>--They have told me--what I have heard,
thanks to you, Madame, was not fit for my young ears. This
interview is cruel--Please let me--</p>
<p><i>Clorinde</i>--No, no! Stay, Mademoiselle. For this interview,
painful to us both, nevertheless concerns us both.</p>
<p><i>C&eacute;lie</i>--I am not your judge, Madame.</p>
<p><i>Clorinde</i>--Nevertheless you do judge me, and severely!
Yes, my life has been blameworthy; I confess it. But you know
nothing of its temptations. How should you know, sweet soul, to
whom life is happy and goodness easy? Child, you have your family
to guard you. You have happiness to keep watch and ward for you.
How should you know what poverty whispers to young ears on cold
evenings! You, who have never been hungry, how should you
understand the price that is asked for a mouthful of bread?</p>
<p><i>C&eacute;lie</i>--I don't know the pleadings of poverty, but
one need not listen to them. There are many poor girls who go
hungry and cold and keep from harm.</p>
<p><i>Clorinde</i>--Child, their courage is sublime. Honor them if
you will, but pity the cowards.</p>
<p><i>C&eacute;lie</i>--Yes, for choosing infamy rather than work,
hunger, or death! Yes, for losing the respect of all honest souls!
Yes, I can pity them for not being worthier of pity.</p>
<p><i>Clorinde</i>--So that's your Christian charity! So nothing in
the world--bitter repentance or agonies of suffering, or vows of
sanctity for all time to come--may obliterate the past?</p>
<p><i>C&eacute;lie</i>--You force me to speak without knowledge.
But--since I must give judgment--who really hates a fault will hate
the fruit of it. If you keep this place, Madame, you will not
expect me to believe in the genuineness of your renunciations.</p>
<p><i>Clorinde</i>--I do not dishonor it. There is no reason why I
should leave it. I have already proved my sincerity by high-minded
and generous acts. I bear myself as my place demands. My conscience
is at rest.</p>
<p><i>C&eacute;lie</i>--Your good action--for I believe you--is
only the beginning of expiation. Virtue seems to me like a holy
temple. You may leave it by a door with a single step, but to enter
again you must climb up a hundred on your knees, beating your
breast.</p>
<p><i>Clorinde</i>--How rigid you all are, and how your parents
train their first-born never to open the ranks! Oh, fortunate race!
impenetrable phalanx of respectability, who make it impossible for
the sinner to reform! You keep the way of repentance so rough that
the foot of poor humanity cannot tread it. God will demand from you
the lost souls whom your hardness has driven back to sin.</p>
<p><i>C&eacute;lie</i>--God, do you say? When good people forgive
they betray his justice. For punishment is not retribution only,
but the acknowledgment and recompense of those fighting ones that
brave hunger and cold in a garret, Madame, yet do not
surrender.</p>
<p><i>Clorinde</i>--Go, child! I cannot bear more--</p>
<p><i>C&eacute;lie</i>--I have said more than I meant to say.
Good-by. This is the first and last time that I shall ever speak of
this.</p>

<h3>A CONTENTED IDLER</h3>
<center>From 'M. Poirier's Son-in-Law'</center>
<p>[<i>The party are leaving the dining-room.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i>--Well, Hector! What do you think of it? The house
is just as you see it now, every day in the year. Do you believe
there is a happier man in the world than I?</p>
<p><i>Duke</i>--Faith! I envy you; you reconcile me to
marriage.</p>
<p><i>Antoinette</i> [<i>in a low voice to Verdelet</i>]--Monsieur
de Montmeyran is a charming young man!</p>
<p><i>Verdelet</i> [<i>in a low voice</i>]--He pleases me.</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i> [<i>to Poirier, who comes in last</i>]--Monsieur
Poirier, I must tell you once for all how much I esteem you. Don't
think I'm ungrateful.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--Oh! Monsieur!</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i>--Why the devil don't you call me Gaston? And you,
too, dear Monsieur Verdelet, I'm very glad to see you.</p>
<p><i>Antoinette</i>--He is one of the family, Gaston.</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i>--Shake hands then, Uncle.</p>
<p><i>Verdelet</i> [<i>aside, giving him his hand</i>]--He's not a
bad fellow.</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i>--Agree, Hector, that I've been lucky. Monsieur
Poirier, I feel guilty. You make my life one long f&ecirc;te and
never give me a chance in return. Try to think of something I can
do for you.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--Very well, if that's the way you feel, give me a
quarter of an hour. I should like to have a serious talk with
you.</p>
<p><i>Duke</i>--I'll withdraw.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--No, stay, Monsieur. We are going to hold a kind
of family council. Neither you nor Verdelet will be in the way.</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i>--The deuce, my dear father-in-law. A family
council! You embarrass me!</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--Not at all, dear Gaston. Let us sit down.</p>
<p>[<i>They seat themselves around the fireplace</i>.]</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i>--Begin, Monsieur Poirier.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--You say you are happy, dear Gaston, and that is
my greatest recompense.</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i>--I'm willing to double your gratification.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--But now that three months have been given to the
joys of the honeymoon, I think that there has been romance enough,
and that it's time to think about history.</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i>--You talk like a book. Certainly, we'll think
about history if you wish. I'm willing.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--What do you intend to do?</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i>--To-day?</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--And to-morrow, and in the future. You must have
some idea.</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i>--True, my plans are made. I expect to do to-day
what I did yesterday, and to-morrow what I shall do to-day. I'm not
versatile, in spite of my light air; and if the future is only like
the present I'll be satisfied.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--But you are too sensible to think that the
honeymoon can last forever.</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i>--Too sensible, and too good an astronomer. But
you've probably read Heine?</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--You must have read that, Verdelet?</p>
<p><i>Verdelet</i>--Yes; I've read him.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--Perhaps he spent his life at playing truant.</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i>--Well, Heine, when he was asked what became of the
old full moons, said that they were broken up to make the
stars.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--I don't understand.</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i>--When our honeymoon is old, we'll break it up and
there'll be enough to make a whole Milky Way.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--That is a clever idea, of course.</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i>--Its only merit is simplicity.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--But seriously, don't you think that the idle
life you lead may jeopardize the happiness of a young
household?</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i>--Not at all.</p>
<p><i>Verdelet</i>--A man of your capacity can't mean to idle all
his life.</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i>--With resignation.</p>
<p><i>Antoinette</i>--Don't you think you'll find it dull after a
time, Gaston?</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i>--You calumniate yourself, my dear.</p>
<p><i>Antoinette</i>--I'm not vain enough to suppose that I can
fill your whole existence, and I admit that I'd like to see you
follow the example of Monsieur de Montmeyran.</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i> [<i>rising and leaning against the
mantelpiece</i>]--Perhaps you want me to fight?</p>
<p><i>Antoinette</i>--No, of course not.</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i>--What then?</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--We want you to take a position worthy of your
name.</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i>--There are only three positions which my name
permits me: soldier, bishop, or husbandman. Choose.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--We owe everything to France. France is our
mother.</p>
<p><i>Verdelet</i>--I understand the vexation of a son whose mother
remarries; I understand why he doesn't go to the wedding: but if he
has the right kind of heart he won't turn sulky. If the second
husband makes her happy, he'll soon offer him a friendly hand.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--The nobility cannot always hold itself aloof, as
it begins to perceive. More than one illustrious name has set the
example: Monsieur de Valcherri&egrave;re, Monsieur de Chazerolles,
Monsieur de Mont Louis--</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i>--These men have done as they thought best. I don't
judge them, but I cannot imitate them.</p>
<p><i>Antoinette</i>--Why not, Gaston?</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i>--Ask Montmeyran.</p>
<p><i>Verdelet</i>--The Duke's uniform answers for him.</p>
<p><i>Duke</i>--Excuse me, a soldier has but one opinion--his duty;
but one adversary--the enemy.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--However, Monsieur--</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i>--Enough, it isn't a matter of politics, Monsieur
Poirier. One may discuss opinions, but not sentiments. I am bound
by gratitude. My fidelity is that of a servant and of a friend. Not
another word. [<i>To the Duke</i>.] I beg your pardon, my dear
fellow. This is the first time we've talked politics here, and I
promise you it shall be the last.</p>
<p><i>The Duke</i> [<i>in a low voice to Antoinette</i>]--You've
been forced into making a mistake, Madame.</p>
<p><i>Antoinette</i>--I know it, now that it's too late.</p>
<p><i>Verdelet</i> [<i>softly, to Poirier</i>]--Now you're in a
fine fix.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i> [<i>in same tone</i>]--He's repulsed the first
assault, but I don't raise the siege.</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i>--I'm not resentful, Monsieur Poirier. Perhaps I
spoke a little too strongly, but this is a tender point with me,
and unintentionally you wounded me. Shake hands.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--You are very kind.</p>
<p><i>A Servant</i>--There are some people in the little parlor who
say they have an appointment with Monsieur Poirier.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--Very well, ask them to wait a moment. [<i>The
servant goes out</i>.] Your creditors, son-in-law.</p>
<p><i>Gaston</i>--Yours, my dear father-in-law. I've turned them
over to you.</p>
<p><i>Duke</i>--As a wedding present.</p>

<h3>THE FEELINGS OF AN ARTIST</h3>
<center>From 'M. Poirier's Son-in-Law'</center>
<p><i>Poirier</i> [<i>alone</i>]--How vexatious he is, that
son-in-law of mine! and there's no way to get rid of him. He'll die
a nobleman, for he will do nothing and he is good for
nothing.--There's no end to the money he costs me.--He is master of
my house.--I'll put a stop to it. [<i>He rings. Enter a
servant</i>.] Send up the porter and the cook. We shall see my
son-in-law! I have set up my back. I've unsheathed my velvet paws.
You will make no concessions, eh, my fine gentleman? Take your
comfort! I will not yield either: you may remain marquis, and I
will again become a <i>bourgeois</i>. At least I'll have the
pleasure of living to my fancy.</p>
<p><i>The Porter</i>--Monsieur has sent for me?</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--Yes, Fran&ccedil;ois, Monsieur has sent for you.
You can put the sign on the door at once.</p>
<p><i>The Porter</i>--The sign?</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--"To let immediately, a magnificent apartment on
the first floor, with stables and carriage houses."</p>
<p><i>The Porter</i>--The apartment of Monsieur le Marquis?</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--You have said it, Fran&ccedil;ois.</p>
<p><i>The Porter</i>--But Monsieur le Marquis has not given the
order.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--Who is the master here, donkey? Who owns this
mansion?</p>
<p><i>The Porter</i>--You, Monsieur.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--Then do what I tell you without arguing.</p>
<p><i>The Porter</i>--Yes, Monsieur. [<i>Enter Vatel</i>.]</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--Go, Fran&ccedil;ois. [<i>Exit Porter</i>.] Come
in, Monsieur Vatel: you are getting up a big dinner for
to-morrow?</p>
<p><i>Vatel</i>--Yes, Monsieur, and I venture to say that the menu
would not be disowned by my illustrious ancestor himself. It is
really a work of art, and Monsieur Poirier will be astonished.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--Have you the menu with you?</p>
<p><i>Vatel</i>--No, Monsieur, it is being copied; but I know it by
heart.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--Then recite it to me.</p>
<p><i>Vatel</i>--Le potage aux ravioles &agrave; l'Italienne et le
potage &agrave; l'orge &agrave; la Marie Stuart.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--You will replace these unknown concoctions by a
good meat soup, with some vegetables on a plate.</p>
<p><i>Vatel</i>--What, Monsieur?</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--I mean it. Go on.</p>
<p><i>Vatel</i>--Relev&eacute;. La carpe du Rhin &agrave; la
Lithuanienne, les poulardes &agrave; la Godard--le filet de boeuf
brais&eacute; aux raisins &agrave; la Napolitaine, le jambon de
Westphalie, rotie mad&egrave;re.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--Here is a simpler and far more sensible fish
course: brill with caper sauce--then Bayonne ham with spinach, and
a savory stew of bird, with well-browned rabbit.</p>
<p><i>Vatel</i>--But, Monsieur Poirier--I will never consent.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--I am master--do you hear? Go on.</p>
<p><i>Vatel</i>--Entr&eacute;es. Les filets de volaille &agrave; la
concordat--les croustades de truffe garni&eacute;s de foies
&agrave; la royale, le faison &eacute;toffe &agrave; la
Montpensier, les perdreaux rouges farcis &agrave; la
bohemienne.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--In place of these side dishes we will have
nothing at all, and we will go at once to the roast,--that is the
only essential.</p>
<p><i>Vatel</i>--That is against the precepts of art.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--I'll take the blame of that: let us have your
roasts.</p>
<p><i>Vatel</i>--It is not worth while, Monsieur: my ancestor would
have run his sword through his body for a less affront. I offer my
resignation.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--And I was about to ask for it, my good friend;
but as one has eight days to replace a servant--</p>
<p><i>Vatel</i>--A servant, Monsieur? I am an artist!</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i>--I will fill your place by a woman. But in the
mean time, as you still have eight days in my service, I wish you
to prepare my menu.</p>
<p><i>Vatel</i>--I will blow my brains out before I dishonor my
name.</p>
<p><i>Poirier</i> [<i>aside</i>]--Another fellow who adores his
name! [<i>Aloud</i>.] You may burn your brains, Monsieur Vatel, but
don't burn your sauces.--Well, <i>bon jour</i>! [<i>Exit
Vatel</i>.] And now to write invitations to my old cronies of the
Rue des Bourdonnais. Monsieur le Marquis de Presles, I'll soon take
the starch out of you.</p>

<h3>A CONTEST OF WILLS</h3>
<center>From 'The Fourchambaults'</center>
<p><i>Madame Fourchambault</i>--Why do you follow me?</p>
<p><i>Fourchambault</i>--I'm not following you: I'm accompanying
you.</p>
<p><i>Madame Fourchambault</i>--I despise you; let me alone. Oh! my
poor mother little thought what a life of privation would be mine
when she gave me to you with a dowry of eight hundred thousand
francs!</p>
<p><i>Fourchambault</i>--A life of privation--because I refuse you
a yacht!</p>
<p><i>Madame Fourchambault</i>--I thought my dowry permitted me to
indulge a few whims, but it seems I was wrong.</p>
<p><i>Fourchambault</i>--A whim costing eight thousand francs!</p>
<p><i>Madame Fourchambault</i>--Would you have to pay for it?</p>
<p><i>Fourchambault</i>--That's the kind of reasoning that's
ruining me.</p>
<p><i>Madame Fourchambault</i>--Now he says I'm ruining him! His
whole fortune comes from me.</p>
<p><i>Fourchambault</i>--Now don't get angry, my dear. I want you
to have everything in reason, but you must understand the
situation.</p>
<p><i>Madame Fourchambault</i>--The situation?</p>
<p><i>Fourchambault</i>--I ought to be a rich man; but thanks to
the continual expenses you incur in the name of your dowry, I can
barely rub along from day to day. If there should be a sudden fall
in stocks, I have no reserve with which to meet it.</p>
<p><i>Madame Fourchambault</i>--That can't be true! Tell me at once
that it isn't true, for if it were so you would be without
excuse.</p>
<p><i>Fourchambault</i>--I or you?</p>
<p><i>Madame Fourchambault</i>--This is too much! Is it my fault
that you don't understand business? If you haven't had the wit to
make the best use of your way of living and your family
connections--any one else--</p>
<p><i>Fourchambault</i>--Quite likely! But I am petty enough to be
a scrupulous man, and to wish to remain one.</p>
<p><i>Madame Fourchambault</i>--Pooh! That's the excuse of all the
dolts who can't succeed. They set up to be the only honest fellows
in business. In my opinion, Monsieur, a timid and mediocre man
should not insist upon remaining at the head of a bank, but should
turn the position over to his son.</p>
<p><i>Fourchambault</i>--You are still harping on that? But, my
dear, you might as well bury me alive! Already I'm a mere cipher in
my family.</p>
<p><i>Madame Fourchambault</i>--You do not choose your time well to
pose as a victim, when like a tyrant you are refusing me a mere
trifle.</p>
<p><i>Fourchambault</i>--I refuse you nothing. I merely explain my
position. Now do as you like. It is useless to expostulate.</p>
<p><i>Madame Fourchambault</i>--At last! But you have wounded me to
the heart, Adrien, and just when I had a surprise for you--</p>
<p><i>Fourchambault</i>--What is your surprise? [<i>Aside</i>: It
makes me tremble.]</p>
<p><i>Madame Fourchambault</i>--Thanks to me, the Fourchambaults
are going to triumph over the Duhamels.</p>
<p><i>Fourchambault</i>--How?</p>
<p><i>Madame Fourchambault</i>--Madame Duhamel has been determined
this long time to marry her daughter to the son of the prefect.</p>
<p><i>Fourchambault</i>--I knew it. What about it?</p>
<p><i>Madame Fourchambault</i>--While she was making a goose of
herself so publicly, I was quietly negotiating, and Baron
Rastiboulois is coming to ask our daughter's hand.</p>
<p><i>Fourchambault</i>--That will never do! I'm planning quite a
different match for her.</p>
<p><i>Madame Fourchambault</i>--You? I should like to know--</p>
<p><i>Fourchambault</i>--He's a fine fellow of our own set, who
loves Blanche, and whom she loves if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p><i>Madame Fourchambault</i>--You are entirely mistaken. You mean
Victor Chauvet, Monsieur Bernard's clerk?</p>
<p><i>Fourchambault</i>--His right arm, rather. His <i>alter
ego</i>.</p>
<p><i>Madame Fourchambault</i>--Blanche did think of him at one
time. But her fancy was just a morning mist, which I easily
dispelled. She has forgotten all about him, and I advise you to
follow her example.</p>
<p><i>Fourchambault</i>--What fault can you find with this young
man?</p>
<p><i>Madame Fourchambault</i>--Nothing and everything. Even his
name is absurd. I never would have consented to be called Madame
Chauvet, and Blanche is as proud as I was. But that is only a
detail; the truth is, I won't have her marry a clerk.</p>
<p><i>Fourchambault</i>--You won't have! You won't have! But there
are two of us.</p>
<p><i>Madame Fourchambault</i>--Are you going to portion
Blanche?</p>
<p><i>Fourchambault</i>--I? No.</p>
<p><i>Madame Fourchambault</i>--Then you see there are not two of
us. As I am going to portion her, it is my privilege to choose my
son-in-law.</p>
<p><i>Fourchambault</i>--And mine to refuse him. I tell you I won't
have your little baron at any price.</p>
<p><i>Madame Fourchambault</i>--Now it is your turn. What fault can
you find with him, except his title?</p>
<p><i>Fourchambault</i>--He's fast, a gambler, worn out by
dissipation.</p>
<p><i>Madame Fourchambault</i>--Blanche likes him just as he
is.</p>
<p><i>Fourchambault</i>--Heavens! He's not even handsome.</p>
<p><i>Madame Fourchambault</i>--What does that matter? Haven't I
been the happiest of wives?</p>
<p><i>Fourchambault</i>--What? One word is as good as a hundred. I
won't have him. Blanche need not take Chauvet, but she shan't marry
Rastiboulois either. That's all I have to say.</p>
<p><i>Madame Fourchambault</i>--But, Monsieur--</p>
<p><i>Fourchambault</i>--That's all I have to say.</p>

<h2>ST. <a name="AUGUSTINE"></a>AUGUSTINE OF HIPPO</h2>
<h3>(354-430)</h3>
<h3>BY SAMUEL HART</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-s.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>t. Augustine of Hippo (Aurelius Augustinus) was born at Tagaste
in Numidia, November 13th, 354. The story of his life has been told
by himself in that wonderful book addressed to God which he called
the 'Confessions'. He gained but little from his father Patricius;
he owed almost everything to his loving and saintly mother Monica.
Though she was a Christian, she did not venture to bring her son to
baptism; and he went away from home with only the echo of the name
of Jesus Christ in his soul, as it had been spoken by his mother's
lips. He fell deeply into the sins of youth, but found no
satisfaction in them, nor was he satisfied by the studies of
literature to which for a while he devoted himself. The reading of
Cicero's 'Hortensius' partly called him back to himself; but before
he was twenty years old he was carried away into Manich&aelig;ism,
a strange system of belief which united traces of Christian
teaching with Persian doctrines of two antagonistic principles,
practically two gods, a good god of the spiritual world and an evil
god of the material world. From this he passed after a while into
less gross forms of philosophical speculation, and presently began
to lecture on rhetoric at Tagaste and at Carthage. When nearly
thirty years of age he went to Rome, only to be disappointed in his
hopes for glory as a rhetorician; and after two years his mother
joined him at Milan.</p>

<b>St. Augustine and His Mother</b><br>
<i>Photogravure from a Painting by Ary Scheffer</i></p>
<br>
<p>The great Ambrose had been called from the magistrate's chair to
be bishop of this important city; and his character and ability
made a great impression on Augustine. But Augustine was kept from
acknowledging and submitting to the truth, not by the intellectual
difficulties which he propounded as an excuse, but by his
unwillingness to submit to the moral demands which Christianity
made upon him. At last there came one great struggle, described in
a passage from the 'Confessions' which is given below; and Monica's
hopes and prayers were answered in the conversion of her son to the
faith and obedience of Jesus Christ. On Easter Day, 387, in the
thirty-third year of his life, he was baptized, an unsubstantiated
tradition assigning to this occasion the composition and first use
of the <i>Te Deum</i>. His mother died at Ostia as they were
setting out for Africa; and he returned to his native land, with
the hope that he might there live a life of retirement and of
simple Christian obedience. But this might not be: on the occasion
of Augustine's visit to Hippo in 391, the bishop of that city
persuaded him to receive ordination to the priesthood and to remain
with him as an adviser; and four years later he was consecrated as
colleague or coadjutor in the episcopate. Thus he entered on a busy
public life of thirty-five years, which called for the exercise of
all his powers as a Christian, a metaphysician, a man of letters, a
theologian, an ecclesiastic, and an administrator.</p>
<p>Into the details of that life it is impossible to enter here; it
must suffice to indicate some of the ways in which as a writer he
gained and still holds a high place in Western Christendom, having
had an influence which can be paralleled, from among uninspired
men, only by that of Aristotle. He maintained the unity of the
Church, and its true breadth, against the Donatists; he argued, as
he so well could argue, against the irreligion of the Manichaeans;
when the great Pelagian heresy arose, he defended the truth of the
doctrine of divine grace as no one could have done who had not
learned by experience its power in the regeneration and conversion
of his own soul; he brought out from the treasures of Holy
Scripture ample lessons of truth and duty, in simple exposition and
exhortation; and in full treatises he stated and enforced the great
doctrines of Christianity.</p>
<p>Augustine was not alone or chiefly the stern theologian whom men
picture to themselves when they are told that he was the Calvin of
those early days, or when they read from his voluminous and often
illogical writings quotations which have a hard sound. If he taught
a stern doctrine of predestinarianism, he taught also the great
power of sacramental grace; if he dwelt at times on the awfulness
of the divine justice, he spoke also from the depths of his
experience of the power of the divine love; and his influence on
the ages has been rather that of the 'Confessions'--taking their
key-note from the words of the first chapter, "Thou, O Lord, hast
made us for Thy-*self, and our heart is unquiet until it find rest
in Thee"--than that of the writings which have earned for their
author the foremost place among the Doctors of the Western Church.
But his greatest work, without any doubt, is the treatise on the
'City of God.' The Roman empire, as Augustine's life passed on, was
hastening to its end. Moral and political declension had doubtless
been arrested by the good influence which had been brought to bear
upon it; but it was impossible to avert its fall. "Men's hearts,"
as well among the heathen as among the Christians, were "failing
them for fear and for looking after those things that were coming
on the earth." And Christianity was called to meet the argument
drawn from the fact that the visible declension seemed to date from
the time when the new religion was introduced into the Roman world,
and that the most rapid decline had been from the time when it had
been accepted as the religion of the State. It fell to the Bishop
of Hippo to write in reply one of the greatest works ever written
by a Christian. Eloquence and learning, argument and irony, appeals
to history and earnest entreaties, are united to move enemies to
acknowledge the truth and to strengthen the faithful in maintaining
it. The writer sets over against each other the city of the world
and the city of God, and in varied ways draws the contrast between
them; and while mourning over the ruin that is coming upon the
great city that had become a world-empire, he tells of the holy
beauty and enduring strength of "the city that hath the
foundations."</p>
<p>Apart from the interest attaching to the great subjects handled
by St. Augustine in his many works, and from the literary
attractions of writings which unite high moral earnestness and the
use of a cultivated rhetorical style, his works formed a model for
Latin theologians as long as that language continued to be
habitually used by Western scholars; and to-day both the spirit and
the style of the great man have a wide influence on the devotional
and the controversial style of writers on sacred subjects.</p>
<p>He died at Hippo, August 28th, 430.</p>

<h3>THE GODLY SORROW THAT WORKETH REPENTANCE</h3>
<center>From the 'Confessions'</center>
<p>Such was the story of Pontitianus: but thou, O Lord, while he
was speaking, didst turn me round towards myself, taking me from
behind my back, when I had placed myself, unwilling to observe
myself; and setting me before my face, that I might see how foul I
was, how crooked and defiled, bespotted and ulcerous. And I beheld
and stood aghast; and whither to flee from myself I found not. And
if I sought to turn mine eye from off myself, he went on with his
relation, and thou didst again set me over against myself, and
thrusted me before my eyes, that I might find out mine iniquity and
hate it. I had known it, but made as though I saw it not, winked at
it, and forgot it.</p>
<p>But now, the more ardently I loved those whose healthful
affections I heard of, that they had resigned themselves wholly to
thee to be cured, the more did I abhor myself when compared with
them. For many of my years (some twelve) had now run out with me
since my nineteenth, when, upon the reading of Cicero's
'Hortensius,' I was stirred to an earnest love of wisdom; and still
I was deferring to reject mere earthly felicity and to give myself
to search out that, whereof not the finding only, but the very
search, was to be preferred to the treasures and kingdoms of the
world, though already found, and to the pleasures of the body,
though spread around me at my will. But I, wretched, most wretched,
in the very beginning of my early youth, had begged chastity of
thee, and said, "Give me chastity and continency, only not yet."
For I feared lest thou shouldest hear me soon, and soon cure me of
the disease of concupiscence, which I wished to have satisfied,
rather than extinguished. And I had wandered through crooked ways
in a sacrilegious superstition, not indeed assured thereof, but as
preferring it to the others which I did not seek religiously, but
opposed maliciously.</p>
<p>But when a deep consideration had, from the secret bottom of my
soul, drawn together and heaped up all my misery in the sight of my
heart, there arose a mighty storm, bringing a mighty shower of
tears. And that I might pour it forth wholly in its natural
expressions, I rose from Alypius: solitude was suggested to me as
fitter for the business of weeping; and I retired so far that even
his presence could not be a burden to me. Thus was it then with me,
and he perceived something of it; for something I suppose he had
spoken, wherein the tones of my voice appeared choked with weeping,
and so had risen up. He then remained where we were sitting, most
extremely astonished. I cast myself down I know not how, under a
fig-tree, giving full vent to my tears; and the floods of mine eyes
gushed out, an acceptable sacrifice to thee. And, not indeed in
these words, yet to this purpose, spake I much unto thee:--"And
thou, O Lord, how long? how long, Lord, wilt thou be
angry--forever? Remember not our former iniquities," for I felt
that I was held by them. I sent up these sorrowful words: "How
long? how long? To-morrow and to-morrow? Why not now? why is there
not this hour an end to my uncleanness?"</p>
<br>
<a name="AUGUSTINE_2"></a>
<h3>CONSOLATION</h3>
<center>From the 'Confessions'</center>
<p>So was I speaking, and weeping, in the most bitter contrition of
my heart, when lo! I heard from a neighboring house a voice, as of
boy or girl (I could not tell which), chanting and oft repeating,
"Take up and read; take up and read." Instantly my countenance
altered, and I began to think most intently whether any were wont
in any kind of play to sing such words, nor could I remember ever
to have heard the like. So, checking the torrent of my tears, I
arose; interpreting it to be no other than a command from God, to
open the book and read the first chapter I should find. Eagerly
then I returned to the place where Alypius was sitting; for there
had I laid the volume of the Epistles when I arose thence. I
seized, opened, and in silence read that section on which my eyes
first fell:--"Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and
wantonness, not in strife and envying; but put ye on the Lord Jesus
Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts
thereof." No further would I read; nor heeded I, for instantly at
the end of this sentence, by a light, as it were, of serenity
infused into my heart, all the darkness of doubt vanished away.</p>

<br>
<p>Then putting my finger between (or some other mark), I shut the
volume, and with a calmed countenance, made it known to Alypius.
And what was wrought in him, which I know not, he thus shewed me.
He asked to see what I had read; I shewed him, and he looked even
farther than I had read, and I knew not what followed. This
followed: "Him that is weak in the faith, receive ye"; which he
applied to himself and disclosed to me. And by this admonition was
he strengthened; and by a good resolution and purpose, and most
corresponding to his character, wherein he did always far differ
from me for the better, without any turbulent delay he joined me.
Thence we go to my mother: we tell her; she rejoiceth: we relate in
order how it took place; she leapeth for joy, and triumpheth and
blesseth thee, "who art able to do above all that we ask or think":

was wont to beg by her pitiful and most sorrowful groanings.</p>
<br>
<a name="AUGUSTINE_3"></a>
<h3>THE FOES OF THE CITY</h3>
<center>From 'The City of God'</center>
<p>Let these and similar answers (if any fuller and fitter answers
can be found) be given to their enemies by the redeemed family of
the Lord Christ, and by the pilgrim city of the King Christ. But
let this city bear in mind that among her enemies lie hid those who
are destined to be fellow-citizens, that she may not think it a
fruitless labor to bear what they inflict as enemies, till they
become confessors of the faith. So also, as long as she is a
stranger in the world, the city of God has in her communion, and
bound to her by the sacraments, some who shall not eternally dwell
in the lot of the saints. Of these, some are not now recognized;
others declare themselves, and do not hesitate to make common cause
with our enemies in murmuring against God, whose sacramental badge
they wear. These men you may see to-day thronging the churches with
us, to-morrow crowding the theatres with the godless. But we have
the less reason to despair of the reclamation of even such persons,
if among our most declared enemies there are now some, unknown to
themselves, who are destined to become our friends. In truth, these
two cities are entangled together in this world, and intermingled
until the last judgment shall effect their separation. I now
proceed to speak, as God shall help me, of the rise and progress
and end of these two cities; and what I write, I write for the
glory of the city of God, that being placed in comparison with the
other, it may shine with a brighter lustre.</p>
<br>
<a name="AUGUSTINE_4"></a>
<h3>THE PRAISE OF GOD</h3>
<center>From 'The City of God'</center>
<p>Wherefore it may very well be, and it is perfectly credible,
that we shall in the future world see the material forms of the new
heavens and the new earth, in such a way that we shall most
distinctly recognize God everywhere present, and governing all
things, material as well as spiritual; and shall see Him, not as we
now understand the invisible things of God, by the things that are
made, and see Him darkly as in a mirror and in part, and rather by
faith than by bodily vision of material appearances, but by means
of the bodies which we shall wear and which we shall see wherever
we turn our eyes. As we do not believe, but see, that the living
men around us who are exercising the functions of life are alive,
although we cannot see their life without their bodies, but see it
most distinctly by means of their bodies, so, wherever we shall
look with the spiritual eyes of our future bodies, we shall also,
by means of bodily substances, behold God, though a spirit, ruling
all things. Either, therefore, the eyes shall possess some quality
similar to that of the mind, by which they shall be able to discern
spiritual things, and among them God,--a supposition for which it
is difficult or even impossible to find any support in
Scripture,--or what is more easy to comprehend, God will be so
known by us, and so much before us, that we shall see Him by the
spirit in ourselves, in one another, in Himself, in the new heavens
and the new earth, in every created thing that shall then exist;
and that also by the body we shall see Him in every bodily thing
which the keen vision of the eye of the spiritual body shall reach.
Our thoughts also shall be visible to all, for then shall be
fulfilled the words of the Apostle, "Judge nothing before the time,
until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things
of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and
then shall every man have praise of God." How great shall be that
felicity, which shall be tainted with no evil, which shall lack no
good, and which shall afford leisure for the praises of God, who
shall be all in all! For I know not what other employment there can
be where no weariness shall slacken activity, nor any want
stimulate to labor. I am admonished also by the sacred song, in
which I read or hear the words, "Blessed are they that dwell in Thy
house; they will be alway praising Thee."</p>
<br>
<a name="AUGUSTINE_5"></a>
<h3>A PRAYER</h3>
<center>From 'The Trinity'</center>
<p>O Lord our God, directing my purpose by the rule of faith, so
far as I have been able, so far as Thou hast made me able, I have
sought Thee, and have desired to see with my understanding what I
have believed; and I have argued and labored much. O Lord my God,
my only hope, hearken to me, lest through weariness I be unwilling
to seek Thee, but that I may always ardently seek Thy face. Do Thou
give me strength to seek, who hast led me to find Thee, and hast
given the hope of finding Thee more and more. My strength and my
weakness are in Thy sight; preserve my strength and heal my
weakness. My knowledge and my ignorance are in Thy sight; when Thou
hast opened to me, receive me as I enter; when Thou hast closed,
open to me as I knock. May I remember Thee, understand Thee, love
Thee. Increase these things in me, until Thou renew me wholly. But
oh, that I might speak only in preaching Thy word and in praising
Thee. But many are my thoughts, such as Thou knowest, "thoughts of
man, that are vain." Let them not so prevail in me, that anything
in my acts should proceed from them; but at least that my judgment
and my conscience be safe from them under Thy protection. When the
wise man spake of Thee in his book, which is now called by the
special name of Ecclesiasticus, "We speak," he says, "much, and yet
come short; and in sum of words, He is all." When therefore we
shall have come to Thee, these very many things that we speak, and
yet come short, shall cease; and Thou, as One, shalt remain "all in
all." And we shall say one thing without end, in praising Thee as
One, ourselves also made one in Thee. O Lord, the one God, God the
Trinity, whatever I have said in these books that is of Thine, may
they acknowledge who are Thine; if I have said anything of my own,
may it be pardoned both by Thee and by those who are Thine.
Amen.</p>

<h2>MARCUS AURELIUS <a name="ANTONINUS"></a>ANTONINUS</h2>
<h3>(121-180 A.D.)</h3>
<h3>BY JAMES FRASER GLUCK</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-m.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>arcus Aurelius, one of the most illustrious emperors of Rome,
and, according to Canon Farrar, "the noblest of pagan emperors",
was born at Rome April 20th, A.D. 121, and died at Vindobona--the
modern Vienna--March 17th, A.D. 180, in the twentieth year of his
reign and the fifty-ninth year of his age.</p>
<p>His right to an honored place in literature depends upon a small
volume written in Greek, and usually called 'The Meditations of
Marcus Aurelius.' The work consists of mere memoranda, notes,
disconnected reflections and confessions, and also of excerpts from
the Emperor's favorite authors. It was evidently a mere private
diary or note-book written in great haste, which readily accounts
for its repetitions, its occasional obscurity, and its frequently
elliptical style of expression. In its pages the Emperor gives his
aspirations, and his sorrow for his inability to realize them in
his daily life; he expresses his tentative opinions concerning the
problems of creation, life, and death; his reflections upon the
deceitfulness of riches, pomp, and power, and his conviction of the
vanity of all things except the performance of duty. The work
contains what has been called by a distinguished scholar "the
common creed of wise men, from which all other views may well seem
mere deflections on the side of an unwarranted credulity or of an
exaggerated despair." From the pomp and circumstance of state
surrounding him, from the manifold cares of his exalted rank, from
the tumult of protracted wars, the Emperor retired into the pages
of this book as into the sanctuary of his soul, and there found in
sane and rational reflection the peace that the world could not
give and could never take away. The tone and temper of the work is
unique among books of its class. It is sweet yet dignified,
courageous yet resigned, philosophical and speculative, yet above
all, intensely practical.</p>
<p>Through all the ages from the time when the Emperor Diocletian
prescribed a distinct ritual for Aurelius as one of the gods; from
the time when the monks of the Middle Ages treasured the
'Meditations' as carefully as they kept their manuscripts of the
Gospels, the work has been recognized as the precious life-blood of
a master spirit. An adequate English translation would constitute
to-day a most valuable <i>vade mecum</i> of devotional feeling and
of religious inspiration. It would prove a strong moral tonic to
hundreds of minds now sinking into agnosticism or materialism.</p>
<br>
<a name="image071.jpg"></a>
<p class="ctr"><a href="images/image071.jpg"><img src=
"images/image071.jpg" width="40%" alt=""></a></p>
<br>
<p>The distinguished French writer M. Martha observes that in the
'Meditations of Marcus Aurelius' "we find a pure serenity,
sweetness, and docility to the commands of God, which before him
were unknown, and which Christian grace has alone surpassed. One
cannot read the book without thinking of the sadness of Pascal and
the gentleness of F&eacute;nelon. We must pause before this soul,
so lofty and so pure, to contemplate ancient virtue in its softest
brilliancy, to see the moral delicacy to which profane doctrines
have attained."</p>
<p>Those in the past who have found solace in its pages have not
been limited to any one country, creed, or condition in life. The
distinguished Cardinal Francis Barberini the elder occupied his
last years in translating the 'Meditations' into Italian; so that,
as he said, "the thoughts of the pious pagan might quicken the
faith of the faithful." He dedicated the work to his own soul, so
that it "might blush deeper than the scarlet of the cardinal robe
as it looked upon the nobility of the pagan." The venerable and
learned English scholar Thomas Gataker, of the religious faith of
Cromwell and Milton, spent the last years of his life in
translating the work into Latin as the noblest preparation for
death. The book was the constant companion of Captain John Smith,
the discoverer of Virginia, who found in it "sweet refreshment in
his seasons of despondency." Jean Paul Richter speaks of it as a
vital help in "the deepest floods of adversity." The French
translator Pierron says that it exalted his soul into a serene
region, above all petty cares and rivalries. Montesquieu declares,
in speaking of Marcus Aurelius, "He produces such an effect upon
our minds that we think better of ourselves, because he inspires us
with a better opinion of mankind." The great German historian
Niebuhr says of the Emperor, as revealed in this work, "I know of
no other man who combined such unaffected kindness, mildness, and
humility with such conscientiousness and severity toward himself."
Renan declares the book to be "a veritable gospel. It will never
grow old, for it asserts no dogma. Though science were to destroy
God and the soul, the 'Meditations of Marcus Aurelius' would remain
forever young and immortally true." The eminent English critic
Matthew Arnold was found on the morning after the death of his
eldest son engaged in the perusal of his favorite Marcus Aurelius,
wherein alone he found comfort and consolation.</p>
<p>The 'Meditations of Marcus Aurelius' embrace not only moral
reflections; they include, as before remarked, speculations upon
the origin and evolution of the universe and of man. They rest upon
a philosophy. This philosophy is that of the Stoic school as
broadly distinguished from the Epicurean. Stoicism, at all times,
inculcated the supreme virtues of moderation and resignation; the
subjugation of corporeal desires; the faithful performance of duty;
indifference to one's own pain and suffering, and the disregard of
material luxuries. With these principles there was, originally, in
the Stoic philosophy conjoined a considerable body of logic,
cosmogony, and paradox. But in Marcus Aurelius these doctrines no
longer stain the pure current of eternal truth which ever flowed
through the history of Stoicism. It still speculated about the
immortality of the soul and the government of the universe by a
supernatural Intelligence, but on these subjects proposed no dogma
and offered no final authoritative solution. It did not forbid man
to hope for a future life, but it emphasized the duties of the
present life. On purely rational grounds it sought to show men that
they should always live nobly and heroicly, and how best to do so.
It recognized the significance of death, and attempted to teach how
men could meet it under any and all circumstances with perfect
equanimity.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>Marcus Aurelius was descended from an illustrious line which
tradition declared extended to the good Numa, the second King of
Rome. In the descendant Marcus were certainly to be found, with a
great increment of many centuries of noble life, all the virtues of
his illustrious ancestor. Doubtless the cruel persecutions of the
infamous Emperors who preceded Hadrian account for the fact that
the ancestors of Aurelius left the imperial city and found safety
in Hispania Baetica, where in a town called Succubo--not far from
the present city of Cordova--the Emperor's great-grandfather,
Annius Verus, was born. From Spain also came the family of the
Emperor Hadrian, who was an intimate friend of Annius Verus. The
death of the father of Marcus Aurelius when the lad was of tender
years led to his adoption by his grandfather and subsequently by
Antoninus Pius. By Antoninus he was subsequently named as joint
heir to the Imperial dignity with Commodus, the son of Aelius
Caesar, who had previously been adopted by Hadrian.</p>
<p>From his earliest youth Marcus was distinguished for his
sincerity and truthfulness. His was a docile and a serious nature.
"Hadrian's bad and sinful habits left him," says Niebuhr, "when he
gazed on the sweetness of that innocent child. Punning on the boy's
paternal name of <i>Verus</i>, he called him <i>Verissimus</i>,
'the <i>most</i> true.'" Among the many statues of Marcus extant is
one representing him at the tender age of eight years offering
sacrifice. He was even then a priest of Mars. It was the hand of
Marcus alone that threw the crown so carefully and skillfully that
it invariably alighted upon the head of the statue of the god. The
entire ritual he knew by heart. The great Emperor Antoninus Pius
lived in the most simple and unostentatious manner; yet even this
did not satisfy the exacting, lofty spirit of Marcus. At twelve
years of age he began to practice all the austerities of Stoicism.
He became a veritable ascetic. He ate most sparingly; slept little,
and when he did so it was upon a bed of boards. Only the repeated
entreaties of his mother induced him to spread a few skins upon his
couch. His health was seriously affected for a time; and it was,
perhaps, to this extreme privation that his subsequent feebleness
was largely due. His education was of the highest order of
excellence. His tutors, like Nero's, were the most distinguished
teachers of the age; but unlike Nero, the lad was in every way
worthy of his instructors. His letters to his dearly beloved
teacher Fronto are still extant, and in a very striking and
charming way they illustrate the extreme simplicity of life in the
imperial household in the villa of Antoninus Pius at Lorium by the
sea. They also indicate the lad's deep devotion to his studies and
the sincerity of his love for his relatives and friends.</p>
<p>When his predecessor and adoptive father Antoninus felt the
approach of death, he gave to the tribune who asked him for the
watchword for the night the reply "Equanimity," directed that the
golden statue of Fortune that always stood in the Emperor's chamber
be transferred to that of Marcus Aurelius, and then turned his face
and passed away as peacefully as if he had fallen asleep. The
watchword of the father became the life-word of the son, who
pronounced upon that father in the 'Meditations' one of the noblest
eulogies ever written. "We should," says Renan, "have known nothing
of Antoninus if Marcus Aurelius had not handed down to us that
exquisite portrait of his adopted father, in which he seems, by
reason of humility, to have applied himself to paint an image
superior to what he himself was. Antoninus resembled a Christ who
would not have had an evangel; Marcus Aurelius a Christ who would
have written his own."</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>It would be impossible here to detail even briefly all the
manifold public services rendered by Marcus Aurelius to the Empire
during his reign of twenty years. Among his good works were these:
the establishment, upon eternal foundation, of the noble fabric of
the Civil Law--the prototype and basis of Justinian's task; the
founding of schools for the education of poor children; the
endowment of hospitals and homes for orphans of both sexes; the
creation of trust companies to receive and distribute legacies and
endowments; the just government of the provinces; the complete
reform of the system of collecting taxes; the abolition of the
cruelty of the criminal laws and the mitigation of sentences
unnecessarily severe; the regulation of gladiatorial exhibitions;
the diminution of the absolute power possessed by fathers over
their children and of masters over their slaves; the admission of
women to equal rights to succession to property from their
children; the rigid suppression of spies and informers; and the
adoption of the principle that merit, as distinguished from rank or
political friendship, alone justified promotion in the public
service.</p>
<p>But the greatest reform was the reform in the Imperial Dignity
itself, as exemplified in the life and character of the Emperor. It
is this fact which gives to the 'Meditations' their distinctive
value. The infinite charm, the tenderness and sweetness of their
moral teachings, and their broad humanity, are chiefly noteworthy
because the Emperor himself practiced in his daily life the
principles of which he speaks, and because tenderness and
sweetness, patience and pity, suffused his daily conduct and
permeated his actions. The horrible cruelties of the reigns of Nero
and Domitian seemed only awful dreams under the benignant rule of
Marcus Aurelius.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that the deification of a deceased emperor,
usually regarded by Senate and people as a hollow mockery, became a
veritable fact upon the death of Marcus Aurelius. He was not
regarded in any sense as mortal. All men said he had but returned
to his heavenly place among the immortal gods. As his body passed,
in the pomp of an imperial funeral, to its last resting-place, the
tomb of Hadrian,--the modern Castle of St. Angelo at
Rome,--thousands invoked the divine blessing of Antoninus. His
memory was sacredly cherished. His portrait was preserved as an
inspiration in innumerable homes. His statue was almost universally
given an honored place among the household gods. And all this
continued during successive generations of men.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>Marcus Aurelius has been censured for two acts: the first, the
massacre of the Christians which took place during his reign; the
second, the selection of his son Commodus as his successor. Of the
massacre of the Christians it may be said, that when the conditions
surrounding the Emperor are once properly understood, no just cause
for condemnation of his course remains. A prejudice against the
sect was doubtless acquired by him through the teachings of his
dearly beloved instructor and friend Fronto. In the writings of the
revered Epictetus he found severe condemnation of the Christians as
fanatics. Stoicism enjoined upon men obedience to the law,
endurance of evil conditions, and patience under misfortunes. The
Christians openly defied the laws; they struck the images of the
gods, they scoffed at the established religion and its ministers.
They welcomed death; they invited it. To Marcus Aurelius, as he
says in his 'Meditations,' death had no terrors. The wise man
stood, like the trained soldier, ready to be called into action,
ready to depart from life when the Supreme Ruler called him; but it
was also, according to the Stoic, no less the duty of a man to
remain until he was called, and it certainly was not his duty to
invite destruction by abuse of all other religions and by contempt
for the distinctive deities of the Roman faith. The Roman State was
tolerant of all religions so long as they were tolerant of others.
Christianity was intolerant of all other religions; it condemned
them all. In persecuting what he regarded as a "pernicious sect"
the Emperor regarded himself only as the conservator of the peace
and the welfare of the realm. The truth is, that Marcus Aurelius
enacted no new laws on the subject of the Christians. He even
lessened the dangers to which they were exposed. On this subject
one of the Fathers of the Church, Tertullian, bears witness. He
says in his address to the Roman officials:--"Consult your annals,
and you will find that the princes who have been cruel to us are
those whom it was held an honor to have as persecutors. On the
contrary, of all princes who have known human and Divine law, name
one of them who has persecuted the Christians. We might even cite
one of them who declared himself their protector,--the wise Marcus
Aurelius. If he did not openly revoke the edicts against our
brethren, he destroyed the effect of them by the severe penalties
he instituted against their accusers." This statement would seem to
dispose effectually of the charge of cruel persecution brought so
often against the kindly and tender-hearted Emperor.</p>
<p>Of the appointment of Commodus as his successor, it may be said
that the paternal heart hoped against hope for filial excellence.
Marcus Aurelius believed, as clearly appears from many passages in
the 'Meditations,' that men did not do evil willingly but through
ignorance; and that when the exceeding beauty of goodness had been
fully disclosed to them, the depravity of evil conduct would appear
no less clearly. The Emperor who, when the head of his rebellious
general was brought to him, grieved because that general had not
lived to be forgiven; the ruler who burned unread all treasonable
correspondence, would not, nay, could not believe in the existence
of such an inhuman monster as Commodus proved himself to be. The
appointment of Commodus was a calamity of the most terrific
character; but it testifies in trumpet tones to the nobility of the
Emperor's heart, the sincerity of his own belief in the triumph of
right and justice.</p>
<p>The volume of the 'Meditations' is the best mirror of the
Emperor's soul. Therein will be found expressed delicately but
unmistakably much of the sorrow that darkened his life. As the book
proceeds the shadows deepen, and in the latter portion his
loneliness is painfully apparent. Yet he never lost hope or faith,
or failed for one moment in his duty as a man, a philosopher, and
an Emperor. In the deadly marshes and in the great forests which
stretched beside the Danube, in his mortal sickness, in the long
nights when weakness and pain rendered sleep impossible, it is not
difficult to imagine him in his tent, writing, by the light of his
solitary lamp, the immortal thoughts which alone soothed his soul;
thoughts which have out-lived the centuries--not perhaps wholly by
chance--to reveal to men in nations then unborn, on continents
whose very existence was then unknown, the Godlike qualities of one
of the noblest of the sons of men.</p>

<h3>EXCERPTS FROM THE 'MEDITATIONS'</h3>
<center>THE BROTHERHOOD OF MAN</center>
<br>
<p>Begin thy morning with these thoughts: I shall meet the meddler,
the ingrate, the scorner, the hypocrite, the envious man, the
cynic. These men are such because they know not to discern the
difference between good and evil. But I know that Goodness is
Beauty and that Evil is Loathsomeness: I know that the real nature
of the evil-doer is akin to mine, not only physically but in a
unity of intelligence and in participation in the Divine Nature.
Therefore I know that I cannot be harmed by such persons, nor can
they thrust upon me what is base. I know, too, that I should not be
angry with my kinsmen nor hate them, because we are all made to
work together fitly like the feet, the hands, the eyelids, the rows
of the upper and the lower teeth. To be at strife one with another
is therefore contrary to our real nature; and to be angry with one
another, to despise one another, <i>is</i> to be at strife one with
another. (Book ii,&sect; I.)</p>
<p>Fashion thyself to the circumstances of thy lot. The men whom
Fate hath made thy comrades here, love; and love them in sincerity
and in truth. (Book vi., &sect; 39.)</p>
<p>This is distinctive of men,--to love those who do wrong. And
this thou shalt do if thou forget not that they are thy kinsmen,
and that they do wrong through ignorance and not through design;
that ere long thou and they will be dead; and more than all, that
the evil-doer hath really done thee no evil, since he hath left thy
conscience unharmed. (Book viii., &sect;22.)</p>
<br>
<center>THE SUPREME NOBILITY OF DUTY</center>
<br>
<p>As A Roman and as a man, strive steadfastly every moment to do
thy duty, with dignity, sincerity, and loving-kindness, freely and
justly, and freed from all disquieting thought concerning any other
thing. And from such thought thou wilt be free if every act be done
as though it were thy last, putting away from thee slothfulness,
all loathing to do what Reason bids thee, all dissimulation,
selfishness, and discontent with thine appointed lot. Behold, then,
how few are the things needful for a life which will flow onward
like a quiet stream, blessed even as the life of the gods. For he
who so lives, fulfills their will. (Book ii., &sect;5.)</p>
<p>So long as thou art doing thy duty, heed not warmth nor cold,
drowsiness nor wakefulness, life, nor impending death; nay, even in
the very act of death, which is indeed only one of the acts of
life, it suffices to do well what then remains to be done. (Book
vi., &sect; 2.)</p>
<p>I strive to do my duty; to all other considerations I am
indifferent, whether they be material things or unreasoning and
ignorant people. (Book vi., &sect;22.)</p>
<br>
<center>THE FUTURE LIFE. IMMORTALITY</center>
<br>
<p>This very moment thou mayest die. Think, act, as if this were
now to befall thee. Yet fear not death. If there are gods they will
do thee no evil. If there are not gods, or if they care not for the
welfare of men, why should I care to live in a Universe that is
devoid of Divine beings or of any providential care? But, verily,
there are Divine beings, and they do concern themselves with the
welfare of men; and they have given unto him all power not to fall
into any real evil. If, indeed, what men call misfortunes were
really evils, then from these things also, man would have been
given the power to free himself. But--thou sayest--are not death,
dishonor, pain, really evils? Reflect that if they were, it is
incredible that the Ruler of the Universe has, through ignorance,
overlooked these things, or has not had the power or the skill to
prevent them; and that thereby what is real evil befalls good and
bad alike. For true it is that life and death, honor and dishonor,
pain and pleasure, come impartially to the good and to the bad. But
none of these things can affect our lives if they do not affect our
true selves. Now our real selves they do not affect either for
better or for worse; and therefore such things are not really good
or evil. (Book ii., &sect;11.)</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>If our spirits live, how does Space suffice for all during all
the ages? Well, how does the earth contain the bodies of those who
have been buried therein during all the ages? In the latter case,
the decomposition and--after a certain period--the dispersion of
the bodies already buried, affords room for other bodies; so, in
the former case, the souls which pass into Space, after a certain
period are purged of their grosser elements and become ethereal,
and glow with the glory of flame as they meet and mingle with the
Creative Energy of the world. And thereby there is room for other
souls which in their turn pass into Space. This, then, is the
explanation that may be given, if souls continue to exist at
all.</p>
<p>Moreover, in thinking of all the bodies which the earth
contains, we must have in mind not only the bodies which are buried
therein, but also the vast number of animals which are the daily
food of ourselves and also of the entire animal creation itself.
Yet these, too, Space contains; for on the one hand they are
changed into blood which becomes part of the bodies that are buried
in the earth, and on the other hand these are changed into the
ultimate elements of fire or air. (Book iv., &sect;21.)</p>
<p>I am spirit and body: neither will pass into nothingness, since
neither came therefrom; and therefore every part of me, though
changed in form, will continue to be a part of the Universe, and
that part will change into another part, and so on through all the
ages. And therefore, through such changes I myself exist; and, in
like manner, those who preceded me and those who will follow me
will exist forever,--a conclusion equally true though the Universe
itself be dissipated at prescribed cycles of time. (Book v., &sect;
13.)</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>How can it be that the gods, who have clothed the Universe with
such beauty and ordered all things with such loving-kindness for
the welfare of man, have neglected this alone, that the best
men--the men who walked as it were with the Divine Being, and who,
by their acts of righteousness and by their reverent service, dwelt
ever in his presence--should never live again when once they have
died? If this be really true, then be satisfied that it is best
that it should be so, else it would have been otherwise ordained.
For whatever is right and just is possible; and therefore, if it
were in accord with the will of the Divine Being that we should
live after death--so it would have been. But because it is
otherwise,--if indeed it be otherwise,--rest thou satisfied that
this also is just and right.</p>
<p>Moreover, is it not manifest to thee that in inquiring so
curiously concerning these things, thou art questioning God himself
as to what is right, and that this thou wouldst not do didst thou
not believe in his supreme goodness and wisdom? Therefore, since in
these we believe, we may also believe that in the government of the
Universe nothing that is right and just has been overlooked or
forgotten. (Book xii., &sect; 5.)</p>
<br>
<center>THE UNIVERSAL BEAUTY OF THE WORLD</center>
<br>
<p>To him who hath a true insight into the real nature of the
Universe, every change in everything therein that is a part thereof
seems appropriate and delightful. The bread that is over-baked so
that it cracks and bursts asunder hath not the form desired by the
baker; yet none the less it hath a beauty of its own, and is most
tempting to the palate. Figs bursting in their ripeness, olives
near even unto decay, have yet in their broken ripeness a
distinctive beauty. Shocks of corn bending down in their fullness,
the lion's mane, the wild boar's mouth all flecked with foam, and
many other things of the same kind, though perhaps not pleasing in
and of themselves, yet as necessary parts of the Universe created
by the Divine Being they add to the beauty of the Universe, and
inspire a feeling of pleasure. So that if a man hath appreciation
of and an insight into the purpose of the Universe, there is
scarcely a portion thereof that will not to him in a sense seem
adapted to give delight. In this sense the open jaws of wild beasts
will appear no less pleasing than their prototypes in the realm of
art. Even in old men and women he will be able to perceive a
distinctive maturity and seemliness, while the winsome bloom of
youth he can contemplate with eyes free from lascivious desire. And
in like manner it will be with very many things which to every one
may not seem pleasing, but which will certainly rejoice the man who
is a true student of Nature and her works. (Book iii., &sect;
2.)</p>
<br>
<center>THE GOOD MAN</center>
<br>
<p>In the mind of him who is pure and good will be found neither
corruption nor defilement nor any malignant taint. Unlike the actor
who leaves the stage before his part is played, the life of such a
man is complete whenever death may come. He is neither cowardly nor
presuming; not enslaved to life nor indifferent to its duties; and
in him is found nothing worthy of condemnation nor that which
putteth to shame. (Book iii., &sect; 8.)</p>
<p>Test by a trial how excellent is the life of the good man;--the
man who rejoices at the portion given him in the universal lot and
abides therein, content; just in all his ways and kindly minded
toward all men. (Book iv., &sect; 25.)</p>
<p>This is moral perfection: to live each day as though it were the
last; to be tranquil, sincere, yet not indifferent to one's fate.
(Book vii., &sect; 69.)</p>
<br>
<center>THE BREVITY OF LIFE</center>
<br>
<p>Cast from thee all other things and hold fast to a few precepts
such as these: forget not that every man's real life is but the
present moment,--an indivisible point of time,--and that all the
rest of his life hath either passed away or is uncertain. Short,
then, the time that any man may live; and small the earthly niche
wherein he hath his home; and short is longest fame,--a whisper
passed from race to race of dying men, ignorant concerning
themselves, and much less really knowing thee, who died so long
ago. (Book iii., &sect; 10.)</p>
<br>
<center>VANITY OF LIFE</center>
<br>
<p>Many are the doctors who have knit their brows over their
patients and now are dead themselves; many are the astrologers who
in their day esteemed themselves renowned in foretelling the death
of others, yet now they too are dead. Many are the philosophers who
have held countless discussions upon death and immortality, and yet
themselves have shared the common lot; many the valiant warriors
who have slain their thousands and yet have themselves been slain
by Death; many are the rulers and the kings of the earth, who, in
their arrogance, have exercised over others the power of life or
death as though they were themselves beyond the hazard of Fate, and
yet themselves have, in their turn, felt Death's remorseless power.
Nay, even great cities--Helice, Pompeii, Herculaneum--have, so to
speak, died utterly. Recall, one by one, the names of thy friends
who have died; how many of these, having closed the eyes of their
kinsmen, have in a brief time been buried also. To conclude: keep
ever before thee the brevity and vanity of human life and all that
is therein; for man is conceived to-day, and to-morrow will be a
mummy or ashes. Pass, therefore, this moment of life in accord with
the will of Nature, and depart in peace: even as does the olive,
which in its season, fully ripe, drops to the ground, blessing its
mother, the earth, which bore it, and giving thanks to the tree
which put it forth. (Book iv., &sect; 48.)</p>
<p>A simple yet potent help to enable one to despise Death is to
recall those who, in their greed for life, tarried the longest
here. Wherein had they really more than those who were cut off
untimely in their bloom? Together, at last, somewhere, they all
repose in death. Cadicianus, Fabius, Julianus, Lepidus, or any like
them, who bore forth so many to the tomb, were, in their turn,
borne thither also. Their longer span was but trivial! Think too,
of the cares thereof, of the people with whom it was passed, of the
infirmities of the flesh! All vanity! Think of the infinite deeps
of Time in the past, of the infinite depths to be! And in that vast
profound of Time, what difference is there between a life of three
centuries and the three days' life of a little child! (Book iv.,
&sect; 50.)</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>Think of the Universe of matter!--an atom thou! Think of the
eternity of Time--thy predestined time but a moment! Reflect upon
the great plan of Fate--how trivial this destiny of thine! (Book
v., &sect; 24.)</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>All things are enveloped in such darkness that they have seemed
utterly incomprehensible to those who have led the philosophic
life--and those too not a few in number, nor of ill-repute. Nay,
even to the Stoics the course of affairs seems an enigma. Indeed,
every conclusion reached seems tentative; for where is the man to
be found who does not change his conclusions? Think too of the
things men most desire,--riches, reputation, and the like,--and
consider how ephemeral they are, how vain! A vile wretch, a common
strumpet, or a thief, may possess them. Then think of the habits
and manners of those about thee--how difficult it is to endure the
least offensive of such people--nay how difficult, most of all, it
is to endure one's self!</p>
<p>Amidst such darkness, then, and such unworthiness, amidst this
eternal change, with all temporal things and even Time itself
passing away, with all things moving in eternal motion, I cannot
imagine what, in all this, is worthy of a man's esteem or serious
effort. (Book v., &sect; 10.)</p>
<br>
<center>DEATH</center>
<br>
<p>To cease from bodily activity, to end all efforts of will and of
thought, to stop all these forever, is no evil. For do but
contemplate thine own life as a child, a growing lad, a youth, an
old man: the change to each of these periods was the death of the
period which preceded it. Why then fear the death of all these--the
death of thyself? Think too of thy life under the care of thy
grandfather, then of thy life under the care of thy mother, then
under the care of thy father, and so on with every change that hath
occurred in thy life, and then ask thyself concerning any change
that hath yet to be, Is there anything to fear? And then shall all
fear, even of the great change,--the change of death
itself,--vanish and flee away. (Book ix., &sect;21.)</p>
<br>
<center>FAME</center>
<br>
<p>Contemplate men as from some lofty height. How innumerable seem
the swarms of men! How infinite their pomps and ceremonies! How
they wander to and fro upon the deep in fair weather and in storm!
How varied their fate in their births, in their lives, in their
deaths! Think of the lives of those who lived long ago, of those
who shall follow thee, of those who now live in uncivilized lands
who have not even heard of thy name, and, of those who have heard
it, how many will soon forget it; of how many there are who now
praise thee who will soon malign thee,--and thence conclude the
vanity of fame, glory, reputation. (Book ix., &sect;30.)</p>
<br>
<center>PRAYER</center>
<br>
<p>The gods are all-powerful or they are not. If they are not, why
pray to them at all? If they are, why dost thou not pray to them to
remove from thee all desire and all fear, rather than to ask from
them the things thou longest for, or the removal of those things of
which thou art in fear? For if the gods can aid men at all, surely
they will grant this request. Wilt thou say that the removal of all
fear and of all desire is within thine own power? If so, is it not
better, then, to use the strength the gods have given, rather than
in a servile and fawning way to long for those things which our
will cannot obtain? And who hath said to thee that the gods will
not <i>strengthen</i> thy will? I say unto thee, begin to pray that
this may come to pass, and thou shalt see what shall befall thee.
One man prays that he may enjoy a certain woman: let thy prayer be
to not have even the desire so to do. Another man prays that he may
not be forced to do his duty: let thy prayer be that thou mayest
not even desire to be relieved of its performance. Another man
prays that he may not lose his beloved son: let thy prayer be that
even the fear of losing him may be taken away. Let these be thy
prayers, and thou shalt see what good will befall thee. (Book ix.,
&sect;41.)</p>
<br>
<center>FAITH</center>
<br>
<p>The Universe is either a chaos or a fortuitous aggregation and
dispersion of atoms; or else it is builded in order and harmony and
ruled by Wisdom. If then it is the former, why should one wish to
tarry in a hap-hazard disordered mass? Why should I be concerned
except to know how soon I may cease to be? Why should I be
disquieted concerning what I do, since whatever I may do, the
elements of which I am composed will at last, at last be scattered?
But if the latter thought be true, then I reverence the Divine One;
I trust; I possess my soul in peace. (Book vi., &sect; 10.)</p>
<br>
<center>PAIN</center>
<br>
<p>If pain cannot be borne, we die. If it continue a long time it
becomes endurable; and the mind, retiring into itself, can keep its
own tranquillity and the true self be still unharmed. If the body
feel the pain, let the body make its moan. (Book vii.,
&sect;30.)</p>
<br>
<center>LOVE AND FORGIVENESS FOR THE EVIL-DOER</center>
<br>
<p>If it be in thy power, teach men to do better. If not, remember
it is always in thy power to forgive. The gods are so merciful to
those who err, that for some purposes they grant their aid to such
men by conferring upon them health, riches, and honor. What
prevents thee from doing likewise? (Book ix., &sect;11.)</p>
<br>
<center>ETERNAL CHANGE THE LAW OF THE UNIVERSE</center>
<br>
<p>Think, often, of how swiftly all things pass away and are no
more--the works of Nature and the works of man. The substance of
the Universe--matter--is like unto a river that flows on forever.
All things are not only in a constant state of change, but they are
the cause of constant and infinite change in other things. Upon a
narrow ledge thou standest! Behind thee, the bottomless abyss of
the Past! In front of thee, the Future that will swallow up all
things that now are! Over what things, then, in this present life,
wilt thou, O foolish man, be disquieted or exalted--making thyself
wretched; seeing that they can vex thee only for a time--a brief,
brief time! (Book v., &sect;23.)</p>
<br>
<center>THE PERFECT LIBERTY OF THE GOOD MAN</center>
<br>
<p>Peradventure men may curse thee, torture thee, kill thee; yet
can all these things not prevent thee from keeping at all times thy
thoughts pure, considerate, sober, and just. If one should stand
beside a limpid stream and cease not to revile it, would the spring
stop pouring forth its refreshing waters? Nay, if such an one
should even cast into the stream mud and mire, would not the stream
quickly scatter it, and so bear it away that not even a trace would
remain? How then wilt thou be able to have within thee not a mere
well that may fail thee, but a fountain that shall never cease to
flow? By wonting thyself every moment to independence in judgment,
joined together with serenity of thought and simplicity in act and
bearing. (Book viii., &sect;51.)</p>
<br>
<center>THE HARMONY AND UNITY OF THE UNIVERSE</center>
<br>
<p>O divine Spirit of the Universe, Thy will, Thy wish is mine!
Calmly I wait Thy appointed times, which cannot come too early or
too late! Thy providences are all fruitful to me! Thou art the
source, Thou art the stay, Thou art the end of all things. The poet
says of his native city, "Dear city of Cecrops"; and shall I not
say of the Universe, "Beloved City of God"? (Book iv.,
&sect;23.)</p>
<p>Either there is a predestined order in the Universe, or else it
is mere aggregation, fortuitous yet not without a certain kind of
order. For how within thyself can a certain system exist and yet
the entire Universe be chaos? And especially when in the Universe
all things, though separate and divided, yet work together in
unity? (Book iv., &sect;27.)</p>
<p>Think always of the Universe as one living organism, composed of
one material substance and one soul. Observe how all things are the
product of a single conception--the conception of a living
organism. Observe how one force is the cause of the motion of all
things: that all existing things are the concurrent causes of all
that is to be--the eternal warp and woof of the ever-weaving web of
existence. (Book iv., &sect;40.)</p>
<br>
<center>THE CONDUCT OF LIFE</center>
<br>
<p>Country houses, retreats in the mountains or by the sea--these
things men seek out for themselves; and often thou, too, dost most
eagerly desire such things. But this does but betoken the greatest
ignorance; for thou art able, when thou desirest, to retreat into
thyself. No otherwhere can a man find a retreat more quiet and free
from care than in his own soul; and most of all, when he hath such
rules of conduct that if faithfully remembered, they will give to
him perfect equanimity,--for equanimity is naught else than a mind
harmoniously disciplined. Cease not then to betake thyself to this
retreat, there to refresh thyself. Let thy rules of conduct be few
and well settled; so that when thou hast thought thereon,
straightway they will suffice to thoroughly purify the soul that
possesses them, and to send thee back, restless no more, to the
things to the which thou must return. With what indeed art thou
disquieted? With the wickedness of men? Meditate on the thought
that men do not do evil of set purpose. Remember also how many in
the past, who, after living in enmity, suspicion, hatred, and
strife one with another, now lie prone in death and are but ashes.
Fret then no more. But perhaps thou art troubled concerning the
portion decreed to thee in the Universe? Remember this alternative:
either there is a Providence or simply matter! Recall all the
proofs that the world is, as it were, a city or a commonwealth! But
perhaps the desires of the body still torment thee? Forget not,
then, that the mind, when conscious of its real self, when
self-reliant, shares not the agitations of the body, be they great
or small. Recall too all thou hast learned (and now holdest as
true) concerning pleasure and pain. But perhaps what men call Fame
allures thee? Behold how quickly all things are forgotten! Before
us, after us, the formless Void of endless ages! How vain is human
praise! How fickle and undiscriminating those who seem to praise!
How limited the sphere of the greatest fame! For the whole earth is
but a point in space, thy dwelling-place a tiny nook therein. How
few are those who dwell therein, and what manner of men are those
who will praise thee!</p>
<p>Therefore, forget not to retire into thine own little country
place,--thyself. Above all, be not diverted from thy course. Be
serene, be free, contemplate all things as a man, as a lover of his
kind, and of his country--yet withal as a being born to die. Have
readiest to thy hand, above all others, these two thoughts: one,
that <i>things</i> cannot touch the soul; the other, that things
are perpetually changing and ceasing to be. Remember how many of
these changes thou thyself hast seen! The Universe is change. But
as thy thoughts are, so thy life shall be. (Book iv., &sect;3.)</p>

<p>All things that befall thee should seem to thee as natural as
roses in spring or fruits in autumn: such things, I mean, as
disease, death, slander, dissimulation, and all other things which
give pleasure or pain to foolish men. (Book iv., &sect;44.)</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>Be thou like a lofty headland. Endlessly against it dash the

<p>"Unhappy me upon whom this misfortune hath fallen!"--nay, rather
thou shouldst say, "Fortunate I, that having met with such a
misfortune, I am able to endure it without complaining; in the
present not dismayed, in the future dreading no evil. Such a
misadventure might have befallen a man who could not, perchance,
have endured it without grievous suffering." Why then shouldst thou
call <i>anything</i> that befalls thee a misfortune, and not the
rather a blessing? Is that a "misfortune," in all cases, which does
not defeat the purpose of man's nature? and does that defeat man's
nature which his <i>Will</i> can accept? And what that <i>Will</i>
can accept, thou knowest. Can this misadventure, then, prevent thy
Will from being just, magnanimous, temperate, circumspect, free
from rashness or error, considerate, independent? Can it prevent
thy Will from being, in short, all that becomes a man? Remember,
then, should anything befall thee which might cause thee to
complain, to fortify thyself with this truth: this is not a
misfortune, while to endure it nobly is a blessing. (Book iv.,
&sect;49.)</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>Be not annoyed or dismayed or despondent if thou art not able to
do all things in accord with the rules of right conduct. When thou
hast not succeeded, renew thy efforts, and be serene if, in most
things, thy conduct is such as becomes a man. Love and pursue the
philosophic life. Seek Philosophy, not as thy taskmaster but to
find a medicine for all thy ills, as thou wouldst seek balm for
thine eyes, a bandage for a sprain, a lotion for a fever. So it
shall come to pass that the voice of Reason shall guide thee and
bring to thee rest and peace. Remember, too, that Philosophy
enjoins only such things as are in accord with thy better nature.
The trouble is, that in thy heart thou prefer-rest those things
which are not in accord with thy better nature. For thou sayest,
"What can be more delightful than these things?" But is not the
word "delightful" in this sense misleading? Are not magnanimity,
broad-mindedness, sincerity, equanimity, and a reverent spirit more
"delightful"? Indeed, what is more "delightful" than Wisdom, if so
be thou wilt but reflect upon the strength and contentment of mind
and the happiness of life that spring from the exercise of the
powers of thy reason and thine intelligence? (Book v.,

<p>As are thy wonted thoughts, so is thy mind; and the soul is
tinged by the coloring of the mind. Let then thy mind be constantly

calm, with a true judgment of thy surroundings and a helpful
knowledge of the things that are seen? So that the Judgment may say
to whatever presents itself, "In truth this is what thou really
art, howsoever thou appearest to men;" and thy Knowledge may say to
whatsoever may come beneath its vision, "Thee I sought; for
whatever presents itself to me is fit material for nobility in
personal thought and public conduct; in short, for skill in work

<p>When thou art annoyed at some one's impudence, straightway ask
thyself, "Is it possible that there should be no impudent men in
the world?" It is impossible. Ask not then the impossible. For such
an one is but one of these impudent persons who needs must be in
the world. Keep before thee like conclusions also concerning the
rascal, the untrustworthy one, and all evil-doers. Then, when it is
quite clear to thy mind that such men must needs exist, thou shalt
be the more forgiving toward each one of their number. This also
will aid thee to observe, whensoever occasion comes, what power for
good, Nature hath given to man to frustrate such viciousness. She
hath bestowed upon man Patience as an antidote to the stupid man,
and against another man some other power for good. Besides, it is
wholly in thine own power to teach new things to the one who hath
erred, for every one who errs hath but missed the appointed path
and wandered away. Reflect, and thou wilt discover that no one of
these with whom thou art annoyed hath done aught to debase thy
<i>mind</i>, and that is the only real evil that can befall
thee.</p>
<p>Moreover, wherein is it wicked or surprising that the ignorant
man should act ignorantly? Is not the error really thine own in not
foreseeing that such an one would do as he did? If thou hadst but
taken thought thou wouldst have known he would be prone to err, and
it is only because thou hast forgotten to use thy Reason that thou
art surprised at his deed. Above all, when thou condemnest another
as untruthful, examine thyself closely; for upon thee rests the
blame, in that thou dost trust to such an one to keep his promise.
If thou didst bestow upon him thy bounty, thine is the blame not to
have given it freely, and without expectation of good to thee, save
the doing of the act itself. What more dost thou wish than to do
good to man? Doth not this suffice,--that thou hast done what
conforms to thy true nature? Must thou then have a reward, as
though the eyes demanded pay for seeing or the feet for walking?
For even as these are formed for such work, and by co-operating in
their distinctive duty come into their own, even so man (by his
real nature disposed to do good), when he hath done some good deed,
or in any other way furthered the Commonweal, acts according to his
own nature, and in so doing hath all that is truly his own. (Book
ix., &sect;42.)</p>
<p>O Man, thou hast been a citizen of this great State, the

a tyrant or an unjust judge, but by Nature who led thee
thither,--even as the manager excuses from the stage an actor whom

<p>True. But in the drama of thy life three acts conclude the play.

<h2>JANE <a name="AUSTEN"></a>AUSTEN</h2>
<h3>(1775-1817)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>he biography of one of the greatest English novelists might be
written in a dozen lines, so simple, so tranquil, so fortunate was
her life. Jane Austen, the second daughter of an English clergyman,
was born at Steventon, in Hampshire, in 1775. Her father had been
known at Oxford as "the handsome proctor," and all his children
inherited good looks. He was accomplished enough to fit his boys
for the University, and the atmosphere of the household was that of
culture, good breeding, and healthy fun. Mrs. Austen was a clever
woman, full of epigram and humor in conversation, and rather famous
in her own coterie for improvised verses and satirical hits at her
friends. The elder daughter, Cassandra, adored by Jane, who was
three years her junior, seems to have had a rare balance and
common-sense which exercised great influence over the more
brilliant younger sister. Their mother declared that of the two
girls, Cassandra had the merit of having her temper always under
her control; and Jane the happiness of a temper that never required
to be commanded.</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/image094.png" width="40%" alt=
""><br>
<b>JANE AUSTEN</b></p>
<p>From her cradle, Jane Austen was used to hearing agreeable
household talk, and the freest personal criticism on the men and
women who made up her small, secluded world. The family
circumstances were easy, and the family friendliness
unlimited,--conditions determining, perhaps, the cheerful tone, the
unexciting course, the sly fun and good-fellowship of her
stories.</p>
<p>It was in this Steventon rectory, in the family room where the
boys might be building their toy boats, or the parish poor folk
complaining to "passon's madam," or the county ladies paying visits
of ceremony, in monstrous muffs, heelless slippers laced over
open-worked silk stockings, short flounced skirts, and lutestring
pelisses trimmed with "Irish," or where tradesmen might be
explaining their delinquencies, or farmers' wives growing voluble
over foxes and young chickens--it was in the midst of this busy and
noisy publicity, where nobody respected her employment, and where
she was interrupted twenty times in an hour, that the shrewd and
smiling social critic managed, before she was twenty-one, to write
her famous 'Pride and Prejudice.' Here too 'Sense and Sensibility'
was finished in 1797, and 'Northanger Abbey' in 1798. The first of
these, submitted to a London publisher, was declined as
unavailable, by return of post. The second, the gay and mocking
'Northanger Abbey,' was sold to a Bath bookseller for &pound;10,
and several years later bought back again, still unpublished, by
one of Miss Austen's brothers. For the third story she seems not
even to have sought a publisher. These three books, all written
before she was twenty-five, were evidently the employment and
delight of her leisure. The serious business of life was that which
occupied other pretty girls of her time and her social
position,--dressing, dancing, flirting, learning a new stitch at
the embroidery frame, or a new air on "the instrument"; while all
the time she was observing, with those soft hazel eyes of hers,
what honest Nym calls the "humors" of the world about her. In 1801,
the family removed to Bath, then the most fashionable
watering-place in England. The gay life of the brilliant little
city, the etiquette of the Pump Room and the Assemblies, regulated
by the autocratic Beau Nash, the drives, the routs, the card
parties, the toilets, the shops, the Parade, the general frivolity,
pretension, and display of the eighteenth century Vanity Fair, had
already been studied by the good-natured satirist on occasional
visits, and already immortalized in the swiftly changing comedy
scenes of 'Northanger Abbey.' But they tickled her fancy none the
less, now that she lived among them, and she made use of them again
in her later novel, 'Persuasion.'</p>
<p>For a period of eight years, spent in Bath and in Southampton,
Miss Austen wrote nothing save some fragments of 'Lady Susan' and
'The Watsons,' neither of them of great importance. In 1809 the
lessened household, composed of the mother and her two daughters
only, removed to the village of Chawton, on the estate of Mrs.
Austen's third son; and here, in a rustic cottage, now become a
place of pilgrimage, Jane Austen again took up her pen. She rewrote
'Pride and Prejudice.' She revised 'Sense and Sensibility,' and
between February 1811 and August 1816 she completed 'Mansfield
Park,' 'Emma,' and 'Persuasion.' At Chawton, as at Steventon, she
had no study, and her stories were written on a little mahogany
desk near a window in the family sitting-room, where she must often
have been interrupted by the prototypes of her Mrs. Allen, Mrs.
Bennet, Miss Bates, Mr. Collins, or Mrs. Norris. When at last she
began to publish, her stories appeared in rapid succession: 'Sense
and Sensibility' in 1811; 'Pride and Prejudice' early in 1813;
'Mansfield Park' in 1814; 'Emma' in 1816; 'Northanger Abbey' and
'Persuasion' in 1818, the year following her death. In January 1813
she wrote to her beloved Cassandra:--"I want to tell you that I
have got my own darling child 'Pride and Prejudice' from London. We
fairly set at it and read half the first volume to Miss B. She was
amused, poor soul! ... but she really does seem to admire
Elizabeth. I must confess that <i>I</i> think her as delightful a
creature as ever appeared in print, and how I shall be able to
tolerate those who do not like <i>her</i> at least, I do not know."
A month later she wrote:--"Upon the whole, however, I am quite vain
enough, and well satisfied enough. The work is rather too light,
and bright, and sparkling: it wants shade; it wants to be stretched
out here and there with a long chapter of sense, if it could be
had; if not, of solemn, specious nonsense, about something
unconnected with the story; an essay on writing, a critique on
Walter Scott, or the history of Bonaparte, or something that would
form a contrast, and bring the reader with increased delight to the
playfulness and epigrammatism of the general style!"</p>
<p>Thus she who laughed at everybody else laughed at herself, and
set her critical instinct to estimate her own capacity. To Mr.
Clarke, the librarian of Carlton House, who had requested her to
"delineate a clergyman" of earnestness, enthusiasm, and learning,
she replied:--"I am quite honored by your thinking me capable of
drawing such a clergyman as you gave the sketch of in your note.
But I assure you I am not. The comic part of the character I might
be equal to, but not the good, the enthusiastic, the literary.... I
think I may boast myself to be, with all possible vanity, the most
unlearned and uninformed female who ever dared to be an authoress."
And when the same remarkable bibliophile suggested to her, on the
approach of the marriage of the Princess Charlotte with Prince
Leopold, that "an historical romance, illustrative of the august
House of Coburg, would just now be very interesting," she
answered:--"I am fully sensible that an historical romance, founded
on the House of Saxe-Coburg, might be much more to the purpose of
profit or popularity than such pictures of domestic life in country
villages as I deal in. But I could no more write a romance than an
epic poem. I could not sit seriously down to write a serious
romance under any other motive than to save my life; and if it were
indispensable to keep it up, and never relax into laughing at
myself or at other people, I am sure that I should be hung before I
had finished the first chapter. No! I must keep to my own style,
and go on in my own way: and though I may never succeed again in
that, I am convinced that I shall totally fail in any other." And
again she writes: "What shall <i>I</i> do with your 'strong, manly,
vigorous sketches, full of variety and glow'? How could I possibly
join them on to the little bit (two inches wide) of ivory on which
I work with so fine a brush as produces little effect, after much
labor?"</p>
<p>Miss Austen read very little. She "detested quartos."
Richardson, Johnson, Crabbe, and Cowper seem to have been the only
authors for whom she had an appreciation. She would sometimes say,
in jest, that "if ever she married at all, she could fancy being
Mrs. Crabbe!" But her bent of original composition, her amazing
power of observation, her inexhaustible sense of humor, her
absorbing interest in what she saw about her, were so strong that
she needed no reinforcement of culture. It was no more in her power
than it was in Wordsworth's to "gather a posy of other men's
thoughts."</p>
<p>During her lifetime she had not a single literary friend. Other
women novelists possessed their sponsors and devotees. Miss Ferrier
was the delight of a brilliant Edinboro' coterie. Miss Edgeworth
was feasted and flattered, not only in England, but on the
Continent; Miss Burney counted Johnson, Burke, Garrick, Windham,
Sheridan, among the admiring friends who assured her that no flight
in fiction or the drama was beyond her powers. But the creator of
Elizabeth Bennet, of Emma, and of Mr. Collins, never met an author
of eminence, received no encouragement to write except that of her
own family, heard no literary talk, and obtained in her lifetime
but the slightest literary recognition. It was long after her death
that Walter Scott wrote in his journal:--"Read again, and for the
third time at least, Miss Austen's finely written novel of <i>Pride
and Prejudice</i>. That young lady had a talent for describing the
involvements and feelings and characters of ordinary life which is
to me the most wonderful I ever met with. The Big Bow-wow strain I
can do myself, like any now going; but the exquisite touch which
renders commonplace things and characters interesting from the
truth of the description and the sentiment is denied to me." It was
still later that Macaulay made his famous estimate of her
genius:--"Shakespeare has neither equal nor second; but among those
who, in the point we have noticed (the delineation of character),
approached nearest the great master, we have no hesitation in
placing Jane Austen as a woman of whom England may justly be proud.
She has given us a multitude of characters, all, in a certain
sense, commonplace, all such as we meet every day. Yet they are all
as perfectly discriminated from each other as if they were the most
eccentric of human beings.... And all this is done by touches so
delicate that they elude analysis, that they defy the powers of
description, and that we know them to exist only by the general
effect to which they have contributed." And a new generation had
almost forgotten her name before the exacting Lewes wrote:--"To
make our meaning precise, we would say that Fielding and Jane
Austen are the greatest novelists in the English language.... We
would rather have written 'Pride and Prejudice' or 'Tom Jones,'
than any of the Waverley novels.... The greatness of Miss Austen
(her marvelous dramatic power) seems more than anything in Scott
akin to Shakespeare."</p>
<p>The six novels which have made so great a reputation for their
author relate the least sensational of histories in the least
sensational way. 'Sense and Sensibility' might be called a novel
with a purpose, that purpose being to portray the dangerous haste
with which sentiment degenerates into sentimentality; and because
of its purpose, the story discloses a less excellent art than its
fellows. 'Pride and Prejudice' finds its motive in the crass pride
of birth and place that characterize the really generous and
high-minded hero, Darcy, and the fierce resentment of his claims to
love and respect on the part of the clever, high-tempered, and
chivalrous heroine, Elizabeth Bennet. 'Northanger Abbey' is a
laughing skit at the school of Mrs. Radcliffe; 'Persuasion,' a
simple story of upper middle-class society, of which the most
charming of her charming girls, Anne Elliot, is the heroine;
'Mansfield Park' a new and fun-loving version of 'Cinderella'; and
finally 'Emma,'--the favorite with most readers, concerning which
Miss Austen said, "I am going to take a heroine whom no one but
myself will much like,"--the history of the blunders of a bright,
kind-hearted, and really clever girl, who contrives as much
discomfort for her friends as stupidity or ill-nature could
devise.</p>
<p>Numberless as are the novelist's characters, no two clergymen,
no two British matrons, no two fussy spinsters, no two men of
fashion, no two heavy fathers, no two smart young ladies, no two
heroines, are alike. And this variety results from the absolute
fidelity of each character to the law of its own development, each
one growing from within and not being simply described from
without. Nor are the circumstances which she permits herself to use
less genuine than her people. What surrounds them is what one must
expect; what happens to them is seen to be inevitable.</p>
<p>The low and quiet key in which her "situations" are pitched
produces one artistic gain which countervails its own loss of
immediate intensity: the least touch of color shows strongly
against that subdued background. A very slight catastrophe among
those orderly scenes of peaceful life has more effect than the
noisier incidents and contrived convulsions of more melodramatic
novels. Thus, in 'Mansfield Park' the result of private
theatricals, including many rehearsals of stage love-making, among
a group of young people who show no very strong principles or
firmness of character, appears in a couple of elopements which
break up a family, occasion a pitiable scandal, and spoil the
career of an able, generous, and highly promising young man. To
most novelists an incident of this sort would seem too ineffective:
in her hands it strikes us as what in fact it is--a tragic
misfortune and the ruin of two lives.</p>
<p>In a word, it is life which Miss Austen sees with unerring
vision and draws with unerring touch; so that above all other
writers of English fiction she seems entitled to the tribute which
an Athenian critic gave to an earlier and more famous
realist,--</p>
<center>"O life! O Menander!<br>
Which of you two is the plagiarist?"</center>

<h3>AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE</h3>
<center>From 'Pride and Prejudice'</center>
<p>The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made
his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of
time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following
Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it
distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a
very orderly manner, with all the observances which he supposed a
regular part of the business. On finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth,
and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he
addressed the mother in these words:--</p>
<p>"May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter
Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honor of a private audience with
her in the course of this morning?"</p>
<p>Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise,
Mrs. Bennet instantly answered: "Oh, dear. Yes; certainly. I am
sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection.
Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs." And, gathering her work
together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out:--</p>
<p>"Dear ma'am, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must
excuse me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not
hear. I am going away myself."</p>
<p>"No, no; nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you will stay where you are."
And upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed
looks, about to escape, she added, "Lizzy, I <i>insist</i> upon
your staying and hearing Mr. Collins."</p>
<p>Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction; and a moment's
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to
get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again,
and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which
were divided between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty
walked off; and as soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began:--</p>
<p>"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far
from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other
perfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there
<i>not</i> been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure
you that I have your respected mother's permission for this
address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however
your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble: my attentions have
been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the
house I singled you out as the companion of my future life. But
before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps
it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying--and
moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of
selecting a wife, as I certainly did."</p>
<p>The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being
run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that
she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop
him further, and he continued:--</p>
<p>"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right
thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to
set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am
convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and
thirdly,--which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier,--that it
is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady
whom I have the honor of calling patroness. Twice has she
condescended to give me her opinion (unasked, too!) on this
subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left
Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was
arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool--that she said, 'Mr. Collins,
you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly,
choose a gentlewoman, for <i>my</i> sake; and for your <i>own</i>,
let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high,
but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice.
Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I
will visit her!' Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin,
that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de
Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer.
You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe; and your
wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her, especially
when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will
inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favor of
matrimony; it remains to be told why my views are directed to
Longbourn instead of my own neighborhood, where, I assure you,
there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as
I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honored father
(who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy
myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters,
that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the
melancholy event takes place,--which, however, as I have already
said, may not be for several years. This has been my motive, my
fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your
esteem. And now, nothing remains for me but to assure you, in the
most animated language, of the violence of my affection. To fortune
I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature
on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied
with; and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents., which
will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all that you
may ever be entitled to. On that head, therefore, I shall be
uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous
reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."</p>
<p>It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.</p>
<p>"You are too hasty, sir," she cried. "You forget that I have
made no answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept
my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible
of the honor of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do
otherwise than decline them."</p>
<p>"I am not now to learn," replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave
of the hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the
addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he
first applies for their favor; and that sometimes the refusal is
repeated a second, or even a third time. I am therefore by no means
discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you
to the altar ere long."</p>
<p>"Upon my word, sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is rather an
extraordinary one, after my declaration. I do assure you that I am
not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who
are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being
asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You
could not make <i>me</i> happy, and I am convinced that I am the
last woman in the world who would make <i>you</i> so. Nay, were
your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would
find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation."</p>
<p>"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr.
Collins, very gravely--"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship
would at all disapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I
have the honor of seeing her again, I shall speak in the highest
terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable
qualifications."</p>
<p>"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You
must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment
of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and
by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being
otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the
delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take
possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any
self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally
settled." And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the
room had not Mr. Collins thus addressed her:--</p>
<p>"When I do myself the honor of speaking to you next on the
subject, I shall hope to receive a more favorable answer than you
have now given me: though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at
present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex
to reject a man on the first application; and perhaps you have even
now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with
the true delicacy of the female character."</p>
<p>"Really, Mr. Collins," cried Elizabeth, with some warmth, "you
puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to
you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my
refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one."</p>
<p>"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that
your refusal of my addresses is merely a thing of course. My
reasons for believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to
me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the
establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable.
My situation in life, my connections with the family of De Bourgh,
and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my
favor; and you should take it into further consideration that, in
spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that
another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your portion is
unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects
of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore
conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall
choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."</p>
<p>"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to
that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable
man. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed
sincere. I thank you again and again for the honor you have done me
in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible. My
feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not
consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you, but
as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart."</p>
<p>"You are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not
fail of being acceptable."</p>
<p>To such perseverance in willful self-deception Elizabeth would
make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined,
if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be
uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behavior at
least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an
elegant female.</p>

<h3>MOTHER AND DAUGHTER</h3>
<center>From 'Pride and Prejudice'</center>
<p>[Lydia Bennet has eloped with the worthless rake Wickham, who
has no intention of marrying her.]</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few
minutes' conversation together, received them exactly as might be
expected: with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against
the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own
suffering and ill-usage;--blaming everybody but the person to whose
ill-judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be
principally owing.</p>
<p>"If I had been able," said she, "to carry my point in going to
Brighton with all my family, <i>this</i> would not have happened;
but poor, dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her. Why did the
Forsters ever let her go out of their sight? I am sure there was
some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind
of girl to do such a thing, if she had been well looked after. I
always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but
I was overruled, as I always am. Poor, dear child! And now here's
Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham, wherever he
meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us
all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his
grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what
we shall do."</p>
<p>They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr.
Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all
her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next
day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavor for recovering
Lydia.</p>
<p>"Do not give way to useless alarm," added he: "though it is
right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on
it as certain. It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In
a few days more, we may gain some news of them; and till we know
that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not
let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as I get to town, I
shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me, to
Grace-church-street, and then we may consult together as to what is
to be done."</p>
<p>"Oh! my dear brother," replied Mrs. Bennet, "that is exactly
what I could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find
them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married
already, <i>make</i> them marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not
let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money
as she chooses to buy them, after they are married. And above all
things, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting. Tell him what a dreadful
state I am in--that I am frightened out of my wits; and have such
tremblings, such flutterings, all over me, such spasms in my side,
and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no
rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to give any
directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does not
know which are the best warehouses. Oh! brother, how kind you are!
I know you will contrive it all."</p>
<p>But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest
endeavors in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to
her, as well in her hopes as her fears; and after talking with her
in this manner till dinner was on the table, they left her to vent
all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended, in the absence
of her daughters.</p>
<p>Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no
real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not
attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence
enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at
table, and judged it better that one only of the household, and the
one whom they could most trust, should comprehend all her fears and
solicitude on the subject.</p>
<p>In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who
had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make
their appearance before. One came from her books, and the other
from her toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm;
and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her
favorite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in the
business, had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the
accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself
to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance of grave reflection,
soon after they were seated at table:--</p>
<p>"This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much
talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the
wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation."</p>
<p>Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she
added, "Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it
this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is
irretrievable--that one false step involves her in endless
ruin--that her reputation is no less brittle than it is
beautiful--and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behavior
towards the undeserving of the other sex."</p>
<p>Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much
oppressed to make any reply.</p>

<h3>A LETTER OF CONDOLENCE</h3>
<center>From 'Pride and Prejudice'</center>
<p>MR. COLLINS TO MR. BENNET, ON HIS DAUGHTER'S ELOPEMENT WITH A
RAKE</p>
<p><i>My Dear Sir</i>:</p>
<p>I feel myself called upon, by our relationship and my situation
in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by letter from
Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and
myself sincerely sympathize with you, and all your respectable
family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest
kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No
arguments shall be wanting, on my part, that can alleviate so
severe a misfortune; or that may comfort you under a circumstance
that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind. The
death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of
this. And it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to
suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness
of behavior in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of
indulgence; though at the same time, for the consolation of
yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own
disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of
such an enormity at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are
grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined by
Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to
whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending
that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the
fortunes of all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself
condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family?
And this consideration leads me, moreover, to reflect with
augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last November; for had
it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrows
and disgrace. Let me advise you, then, my dear sir, to console
yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from
your affection forever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own
heinous offense.</p>
<p>I am, dear sir, etc., etc.</p>

<h3>A WELL-MATCHED SISTER AND BROTHER</h3>
<center>From 'Northanger Abbey'</center>
<p>"My dearest Catherine, have you settled what to wear on your
head to-night? I am determined, at all events, to be dressed
exactly like you. The men take notice of <i>that</i> sometimes, you
know."</p>
<p>"But it does not signify if they do," said Catherine, very
innocently.</p>
<p>"Signify! oh, heavens! I make it a rule never to mind what they
say. They are very often amazingly impertinent, if you do not treat
them with spirit, and make them keep their distance."</p>
<p>"Are they? Well I never observed <i>that</i>. They always behave
very well to me."</p>
<p>"Oh! they give themselves such airs. They are the most conceited
creatures in the world, and think themselves of so much importance!
By the by, though I have thought of it a hundred times, I have
always forgot to ask you what is your favorite complexion in a man.
Do you like them best dark or fair?"</p>
<p>"I hardly know. I never much thought about it. Something between
both, I think--brown: not fair, and not very dark."</p>
<p>"Very well, Catherine. That is exactly he. I have not forgot
your description of Mr. Tilney: 'a brown skin, with dark eyes, and
rather dark hair.' Well, my taste is different. I prefer light
eyes; and as to complexion, do you know, I like a sallow better
than any other. You must not betray me, if you should ever meet
with one of your acquaintance answering that description."</p>
<p>"Betray you! What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Nay, do not distress me. I believe I have said too much. Let us
drop the subject."</p>
<p>Catherine, in some amazement, complied; and after remaining a
few moments silent, was on the point of reverting to what
interested her at that time rather more than anything else in the
world, Laurentina's skeleton, when her friend prevented her by
saying, "For Heaven's sake! let us move away from this end of the
room. Do you know, there are two odious young men who have been
staring at me this half-hour. They really put me quite out of
countenance. Let us go and look at the arrivals. They will hardly
follow us there."</p>
<p>Away they walked to the book; and while Isabella examined the
names, it was Catherine's employment to watch the proceedings of
these alarming young men.</p>
<p>"They are not coming this way, are they? I hope they are not so
impertinent as to follow us. Pray let me know if they are coming. I
am determined I will not look up."</p>
<p>In a few moments Catherine, with unaffected pleasure, assured
her that she need not be longer uneasy, as the gentlemen had just
left the Pump-room.</p>
<p>"And which way are they gone?" said Isabella, turning hastily
round. "One was a very good-looking young man."</p>
<p>"They went towards the churchyard."</p>
<p>"Well, I am amazingly glad I have got rid of them! And now what
say you to going to Edgar's Buildings with me, and looking at my
new hat? You said you should like to see it."</p>
<p>Catherine readily agreed. "Only," she added, "perhaps we may
overtake the two young men."</p>
<p>"Oh! never mind that. If we make haste, we shall pass by them
presently, and I am dying to show you my hat."</p>
<p>"But if we only wait a few minutes, there will be no danger of
our seeing them at all."</p>
<p>"I shall not pay them any such compliment, I assure you. I have
no notion of treating men with such respect. <i>That</i> is the way
to spoil them."</p>
<p>Catherine had nothing to oppose against such reasoning; and
therefore, to show the independence of Miss Thorpe, and her
resolution of humbling the sex, they set off immediately, as fast
as they could walk, in pursuit of the two young men.</p>
<p>Half a minute conducted them through the Pump-yard to the
archway, opposite Union Passage; but here they were stopped.
Everybody acquainted with Bath may remember the difficulties of
crossing Cheap Street at this point; it is indeed a street of so
impertinent a nature, so unfortunately connected with the great
London and Oxford roads, and the principal inn of the city, that a
day never passes in which parties of ladies, however important
their business, whether in quest of pastry, millinery, or even (as
in the present case) of young men, are not detained on one side or
other by carriages, horsemen, or carts. This evil had been felt and
lamented, at least three times a day, by Isabella since her
residence in Bath: and she was now fated to feel and lament it once
more; for at the very moment of coming opposite to Union Passage,
and within view of the two gentlemen who were proceeding through
the crowds and treading the gutters of that interesting alley, they
were prevented crossing by the approach of a gig, driven along on
bad pavements by a most knowing-looking coachman, with all the
vehemence that could most fitly endanger the lives of himself, his
companion, and his horse.</p>
<p>"Oh, these odious gigs!" said Isabella, looking up, "how I
detest them!" But this detestation, though so just, was of short
duration, for she looked again, and exclaimed, "Delightful! Mr.
Morland and my brother!"</p>
<p>"Good Heaven! 'tis James!" was uttered at the same moment by
Catherine; and on catching the young men's eyes, the horse was
immediately checked with a violence which almost threw him on his
haunches; and the servant having now scampered up, the gentlemen
jumped out, and the equipage was delivered to his care.</p>
<p>Catherine, by whom this meeting was wholly unexpected, received
her brother with the liveliest pleasure; and he, being of a very
amiable disposition, and sincerely attached to her, gave every
proof on his side of equal satisfaction, which he could have
leisure to do, while the bright eyes of Miss Thorpe were
incessantly challenging his notice; and to her his devoirs were
speedily paid, with a mixture of joy and embarrassment which might
have informed Catherine, had she been more expert in the
development of other people's feelings, and less simply engrossed
by her own, that her brother thought her friend quite as pretty as
she could do herself.</p>
<p>John Thorpe, who in the mean time had been giving orders about
the horse, soon joined them, and from him she directly received the
amends which were her due; for while he slightly and carelessly
touched the hand of Isabella, on her he bestowed a whole scrape and
half a short bow. He was a stout young man, of middling height,
who, with a plain face and ungraceful form, seemed fearful of being
too handsome unless he wore the dress of a groom, and too much like
a gentleman unless he were easy where he ought to be civil, and
impudent where he might be allowed to be easy. He took out his
watch:--"How long do you think we have been running in from
Tetbury, Miss Morland?"</p>
<p>"I do not know the distance." Her brother told her that it was
twenty-three miles.</p>
<p>"<i>Three</i>-and-twenty!" cried Thorpe; "five-and-twenty if it
is an inch." Morland remonstrated, pleaded the authority of
road-books, innkeepers, and milestones: but his friend disregarded
them all; he had a surer test of distance. "I know it must be
five-and-twenty," said he, "by the time we have been doing it." "It
is now half after one; we drove out of the inn-yard at Tetbury as
the town-clock struck eleven; and I defy any man in England to make
my horse go less than ten miles an hour in harness; that makes it
exactly twenty-five."</p>
<p>"You have lost an hour," said Morland: "it was only ten o'clock
when we came from Tetbury."</p>
<p>"Ten o'clock! it was eleven, upon my soul! I counted every
stroke. This brother of yours would persuade me out of my senses,
Miss Morland. Do but look at my horse: did you ever see an animal
so made for speed in your life?" (The servant had just mounted the
carriage and was driving off.) "Such true blood! Three hours and a
half, indeed, coming only three-and-twenty miles! Look at that
creature, and suppose it possible, if you can!"</p>
<p>"He <i>does</i> look very hot, to be sure."</p>
<p>"Hot! he had not turned a hair till we came to Walcot Church:
but look at his forehand; look at his loins; only see how he moves:
that horse <i>cannot</i> go less than ten miles an hour; tie his
legs, and he will get on. What do you think of my gig, Miss
Morland? A neat one, is it not? Well hung; town built: I have not
had it a month. It was built for a Christ Church man, a friend of
mine, a very good sort of fellow; he ran it a few weeks, till, I
believe, it was convenient to have done with it. I happened just
then to be looking out for some light thing of the kind, though I
had pretty well determined on a curricle too; but I chanced to meet
him on Magdalen Bridge, as he was driving into Oxford, last term:
'Ah, Thorpe,' said he, 'do you happen to want such a little thing
as this? It is a capital one of the kind, but I am cursed tired of
it.' 'Oh! d----,' said I, 'I am your man; what do you ask?' And how
much do you think he did, Miss Morland?"</p>
<p>"I am sure I cannot guess at all."</p>
<p>"Curricle-hung, you see; seat, trunk, sword-case,
splashing-board, lamps, silver molding, all, you see, complete; the
ironwork as good as new, or better. He asked fifty guineas: I
closed with him directly, threw down the money, and the carriage
was mine."</p>
<p>"And I am sure," said Catherine, "I know so little of such
things, that I cannot judge whether it was cheap or dear."</p>
<p>"Neither one nor t'other; I might have got it for less, I dare
say; but I hate haggling, and poor Freeman wanted cash."</p>
<p>"That was very good-natured of you," said Catherine, quite
pleased.</p>
<p>"Oh! d---- it, when one has the means of doing a kind thing by a
friend, I hate to be pitiful."</p>
<p>An inquiry now took place into the intended movements of the
young ladies; and on finding whither they were going, it was
decided that the gentlemen should accompany them to Edgar's
Buildings, and pay their respects to Mrs. Thorpe. James and
Isabella led the way; and so well satisfied was the latter with her
lot, so contentedly was she endeavoring to insure a pleasant walk
to him who brought the double recommendation of being her brother's
friend and her friend's brother, so pure and uncoquettish were her
feelings, that though they overtook and passed the two offending
young men in Milsom Street, she was so far from seeking to attract
their notice that she looked back at them only three times.</p>
<p>John Thorpe kept of course with Catherine, and after a few
minutes' silence renewed the conversation about his gig:--"You will
find, however, Miss Morland, it would be reckoned a cheap thing by
some people, for I might have sold it for ten guineas more the next
day; Jackson of Oriel bid me sixty at once; Morland was with me at
the time."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Morland, who overheard this; "bet you forgot that
your horse was included."</p>
<p>"My horse! oh, d---- it! I would not sell my horse for a
hundred. Are you fond of an open carriage, Miss Morland?"</p>
<p>"Yes, very: I have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one;
but I am particularly fond of it."</p>
<p>"I am glad of it: I will drive you out in mine every day."</p>
<p>"Thank you," said Catherine, in some distress, from a doubt of
the propriety of accepting such an offer.</p>
<p>"I will drive you up Lansdown Hill to-morrow."</p>
<p>"Thank you; but will not your horse want rest?"</p>
<p>"Rest! he has only come three-and-twenty miles to-day; all
nonsense: nothing ruins horses so much as rest; nothing knocks them
up so soon. No, no: I shall exercise mine at the average of four
hours every day while I am here."</p>
<p>"Shall you, indeed!" said Catherine, very seriously: "that will
be forty miles a day."</p>
<p>"Forty! ay, fifty, for what I care. Well, I will drive you up
Lansdown to-morrow; mind, I am engaged."</p>
<p>"How delightful that will be!" cried Isabella, turning round;
"my dearest Catherine, I quite envy you; but I am afraid, brother,
you will not have room for a third."</p>
<p>"A third, indeed! no, no; I did not come to Bath to drive my
sisters about: that would be a good joke, faith! Morland must take
care of you."</p>
<p>This brought on a dialogue of civilities between the other two;
but Catherine heard neither the particulars nor the result. Her
companion's discourse now sunk from its hitherto animated pitch to
nothing more than a short, decisive sentence of praise or
condemnation on the face of every women they met; and Catherine,
after listening and agreeing as long as she could, with all the
civility and deference of the youthful female mind, fearful of
hazarding an opinion of its own in opposition to that of a
self-assured man, especially where the beauty of her own sex is
concerned, ventured at length to vary the subject by a question
which had been long uppermost in her thoughts. It was, "Have you
ever read 'Udolpho,' Mr. Thorpe?"</p>
<p>"'Udolpho'! O Lord! not I: I never read novels; I have something
else to do."</p>
<p>Catherine, humbled and ashamed, was going to apologize for her
question; but he prevented her by saying, "Novels are all so full
of nonsense and stuff! there has not been a tolerable decent one
come out since 'Tom Jones,' except the 'Monk'; I read that t'other
day: but as for all the others, they are the stupidest things in
creation."</p>
<p>"I think you must like 'Udolpho,' if you were to read it: it is
so very interesting."</p>
<p>"Not I, faith! No, if I read any, it shall be Mrs. Radcliffe's;
her novels are amusing enough: they are worth reading; some fun and
nature in <i>them</i>.</p>
<p>"'Udolpho' was written by Mrs. Radcliffe," said Catherine, with
some hesitation, from the fear of mortifying him.</p>
<p>"No, sure; was it? Ay, I remember, so it was; I was thinking of
that other stupid book, written by that woman they made such a fuss
about; she who married the French emigrant."</p>
<p>"I suppose you mean 'Camilla'?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that's the book: such unnatural stuff! An old man playing
at see-saw: I took up the first volume once, and looked it over,
but I soon found it would not do; indeed, I guessed what sort of
stuff it must be before I saw it; as soon as I heard she had
married an emigrant, I was sure I should never be able to get
through it."</p>
<p>"I have never read it."</p>
<p>"You have no loss, I assure you; it is the horridest nonsense
you can imagine: there is nothing in the world in it but an old
man's playing at see-saw and learning Latin; upon my soul, there is
not."</p>
<p>This critique, the justness of which was unfortunately lost on
poor Catherine, brought them to the door of Mrs. Thorpe's lodgings,
and the feelings of the discerning and unprejudiced reader of
'Camilla' gave way to the feelings of the dutiful and affectionate
son, as they met Mrs. Thorpe, who had descried them from above, in
the passage. "Ah, mother, how do you do?" said he, giving her a
hearty shake of the hand; "where did you get that quiz of a hat? it
makes you look like an old witch. Here is Morland and I come to
stay a few days with you; so you must look out for a couple of good
beds somewhere near." And this address seemed to satisfy all the
fondest wishes of the mother's heart, for she received him with the
most delighted and exulting affection. On his two younger sisters
he then bestowed an equal portion of his fraternal tenderness, for
he asked each of them how they did, and observed that they both
looked very ugly.</p>

<h3>FAMILY DOCTORS</h3>
<center>From 'Emma'</center>
<p>While they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was
enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and tearful affection with
his daughter.</p>
<p>"My poor, dear Isabella," said he, fondly taking her hand, and
interrupting for a few moments her busy labors for some one of her
five children, "how long it is, how terribly long since you were
here! And how tired you must be after your journey! You must go to
bed early, my dear,--and I recommend a little gruel to you before
you go. You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together. My dear
Emma, suppose we all have a little gruel."</p>
<p>Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did that
both the Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as
herself, and two basins only were ordered. After a little more
discourse in praise of gruel, with some wondering at its not being
taken every evening by everybody, he proceeded to say, with an air
of grave reflection:--</p>
<p>"It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn
at South End instead of coming here. I never had much opinion of
the sea air."</p>
<p>"Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir, or we
should not have gone. He recommended it for all the children, but
particularly for the weakness in little Bella's throat,--both sea
air and bathing."</p>
<p>"Ah, my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her
any good; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced,
though perhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very
rarely of use to anybody. I am sure it almost killed me once."</p>
<p>"Come, come," cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject,
"I must beg you not to talk of the sea. It makes me envious and
miserable; I who have never seen it! South End is prohibited, if
you please. My dear Isabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry
after Mr. Perry yet; and he never forgets you."</p>
<p>"Oh, good Mr. Perry, how is he, sir?"</p>
<p>"Why, pretty well; but not quite well. Poor Perry is bilious,
and he has not time to take care of himself; he tells me he has not
time to take care of himself--which is very sad--but he is always
wanted all round the country. I suppose there is not a man in such
practice anywhere. But then, there is not so clever a man
anywhere."</p>
<p>"And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? Do the children
grow? I have a great regard for Mr. Perry. I hope he will be
calling soon. He will be so pleased to see my little ones."</p>
<p>"I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two
to ask him about myself of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever
he comes, you had better let him look at little Bella's
throat."</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have
hardly any uneasiness about it. Either bathing has been of the
greatest service to her, or else it is to be attributed to an
excellent embrocation of Mr. Wingfield's, which we have been
applying at times ever since August."</p>
<p>"It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been
of use to her; and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation,
I would have spoken to--"</p>
<p>"You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates," said
Emma: "I have not heard one inquiry after them."</p>
<p>"Oh, the good Bateses--I am quite ashamed of myself; but you
mention them in most of your letters. I hope they are quite well.
Good old Mrs. Bates. I will call upon her to-morrow, and take my
children. They are always so pleased to see my children. And that
excellent Miss Bates!--such thorough worthy people! How are they,
sir?"</p>
<p>"Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor Mrs. Bates
had a bad cold about a month ago."</p>
<p>"How sorry I am! but colds were never so prevalent as they have
been this autumn. Mr. Wingfield told me that he had never known
them more general or heavy, except when it has been quite an
influenza."</p>
<p>"That has been a good deal the case, my dear, but not to the
degree you mention. Perry says that colds have been very general,
but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November. Perry
does not call it altogether a sickly season."</p>
<p>"No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it <i>very</i>
sickly, except--"</p>
<p>"Ah, my poor, dear child, the truth is, that in London it is
always a sickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be.
It is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there;--so far
off!--and the air so bad!"</p>
<p>"No, indeed, <i>we</i> are not at all in a bad air. Our part of
London is so very superior to most others. You must not confound us
with London in general, my dear sir. The neighborhood of Brunswick
Square is very different from almost all the rest. We are so very
airy! I should be unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of
the town; there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to
have my children in: but <i>we</i> are so remarkably airy! Mr.
Wingfield thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the
most favorable as to air."</p>
<p>"Ah, my dear, it is not like Hartfield. You make the best of
it--but after you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you
different creatures; you do not look like the same. Now, I cannot
say that I think you are any of you looking well at present."</p>
<p>"I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting
those little nervous headaches and palpitations which I am never
entirely free from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the
children were rather pale before they went to bed, it was only
because they were a little more tired than usual from their journey
and the happiness of coming. I hope you will think better of their
looks to-morrow; for I assure you Mr. Wingfield told me that he did
not believe he had ever sent us off, altogether, in such good case.
I trust at least that you do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,"
turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety toward her husband.</p>
<p>"Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. John
Knightley very far from looking well."</p>
<p>"What is the matter, sir? Did you speak to me?" cried Mr. John
Knightley, hearing his own name.</p>
<p>"I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you
looking well; but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I
could have wished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr.
Wingfield before you left home."</p>
<p>"My dear Isabella," exclaimed he hastily, "pray do not concern
yourself about my looks. Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling
yourself and the children, and let me look as I choose."</p>
<p>"I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your
brother," cried Emma, "about your friend Mr. Graham's intending to
have a bailiff from Scotland to look after his new estate. But will
it answer? Will not the old prejudice be too strong?"</p>
<p>And she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when
forced to give her attention again to her father and sister, she
had nothing worse to hear than Isabella's kind inquiry after Jane
Fairfax; and Jane Fairfax, though no great favorite with her in
general, she was at that moment very happy to assist in
praising.</p>
<p>"That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!" said Mrs. John Knightley.
"It is so long since I have seen her, except now and then for a
moment accidentally in town. What happiness it must be to her good
old grandmother and excellent aunt when she comes to visit them! I
always regret excessively, on dear Emma's account, that she cannot
be more at Highbury; but now their daughter is married I suppose
Colonel and Mrs. Campbell will not be able to part with her at all.
She would be such a delightful companion for Emma."</p>
<p>Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added:--</p>
<p>"Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another
pretty kind of young person. You will like Harriet. Emma could not
have a better companion than Harriet."</p>
<p>"I am most happy to hear it; but only Jane Fairfax one knows to
be so very accomplished and superior, and exactly Emma's age."</p>
<p>This topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of
similar moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the
evening did not close without a little return of agitation. The
gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said--much praise and
many comments--undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every
constitution, and pretty severe philippies upon the many houses
where it was never met with tolerably; but unfortunately, among the
failures which the daughter had to instance, the most recent and
therefore most prominent was in her own cook at South End, a young
woman hired for the time, who never had been able to understand
what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel, thin, but not too
thin. Often as she had wished for and ordered it, she had never
been able to get anything tolerable. Here was a dangerous
opening.</p>
<p>"Ah," said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head, and fixing his eyes
on her with tender concern. The ejaculation in Emma's ear
expressed, "Ah, there is no end of the sad consequences of your
going to South End. It does not bear talking of." And for a little
while she hoped he would not talk of it, and that a silent
rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own
smooth gruel. After an interval of some minutes, however, he began
with--</p>
<p>"I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this
autumn, instead of coming here."</p>
<p>"But why should you be sorry, sir? I assure you it did the
children a great deal of good."</p>
<p>"And moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not have
been to South End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was
surprised to hear you had fixed upon South End."</p>
<p>"I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is
quite a mistake, sir. We all had our health perfectly well there,
never found the least inconvenience from the mud, and Mr. Wingfield
says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I
am sure he may be depended on, for he thoroughly understands the
nature of the air, and his own brother and family have been there
repeatedly."</p>
<p>"You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.
Perry was a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best of
all the sea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure
air. And by what I understand, you might have had lodgings there
quite away from the sea--a quarter of a mile off--very comfortable.
You should have consulted Perry."</p>
<p>"But my dear sir, the difference of the journey: only consider
how great it would have been. A hundred miles, perhaps, instead of
forty."</p>
<p>"Ah, my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing
else should be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not
much to choose between forty miles and a hundred. Better not move
at all, better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to
get into a worse air. This is just what Perry said. It seemed to
him a very ill-judged measure."</p>
<p>Emma's attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he
had reached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her
brother-in-law's breaking out.</p>
<p>"Mr. Perry," said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure,
"would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for. Why
does he make it any business of his to wonder at what I do at my
taking my family to one part of the coast or another? I may be
allowed, I hope, the use of my judgment as well as Mr. Perry. I
want his directions no more than his drugs." He paused, and growing
cooler in a moment, added, with only sarcastic dryness, "If Mr.
Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance
of a hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or
inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as willing to
prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself."</p>
<p>"True, true," cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready
interposition, "very true. That's a consideration, indeed. But,
John, as to what I was telling you of my idea of moving the path to
Langham, of turning it more to the right that it may not cut
through the home meadows, I cannot conceive any difficulty. I
should not attempt it, if it were to be the means of inconvenience
to the Highbury people, but if you call to mind exactly the present
light of the path--The only way of proving it, however, will be to
turn to our maps. I shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow morning, I
hope, and then we will look them over, and you shall give me your
opinion."</p>
<p>Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on
his friend Perry, to whom he had in fact, though unconsciously,
been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions; but the
soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present
evil, and the immediate alertness of one brother, and better
recollections of the other, prevented any renewal of it.</p>

<h3>FAMILY TRAINING</h3>
<center>From 'Mansfield Park'</center>
<p>As her [Fanny Price's] appearance and spirits improved, Sir
Thomas and Mrs. Norris thought with greater satisfaction of their
benevolent plan; and it was pretty soon decided between them, that
though far from clever, she showed a tractable disposition, and
seemed likely to give them little trouble. A mean opinion of her
abilities was not confined to <i>them</i>. Fanny could read, work,
and write, but she had been taught nothing more; and as her cousins
found her ignorant of many things with which they had been long
familiar, they thought her prodigiously stupid, and for the first
two or three weeks were continually bringing some fresh report of
it into the drawing-room.</p>
<p>"Dear mamma, only think, my cousin cannot put the map of Europe
together"--or "my cousin cannot tell the principal rivers in
Russia"--or "she never heard of Asia Minor"--or "she does not know
the difference between water-colors and crayons! How strange! Did
you ever hear anything so stupid?"</p>
<p>"My dear," their aunt would reply, "it is very bad, but you must
not expect everybody to be as quick at learning as yourself."</p>
<p>"But, aunt, she is really so very ignorant! Do you know, we
asked her last night which way she would go to get to Ireland; and
she said she should cross to the Isle of Wight. She thinks of
nothing but the Isle of Wight, and she calls it <i>the Island</i>,
as if there were no other island in the world. I am sure I should
have been ashamed of myself, if I had not known better long before
I was so old as she is. I cannot remember the time when I did not
know a great deal that she has not the least notion of yet. How
long ago it is, aunt, since we used to repeat the chronological
order of the kings of England, with the dates of their accession,
and most of the principal events of their reigns!"</p>
<p>"Yes," added the other; "and of the Roman emperors as low as
Severus; besides a great deal of the heathen mythology, and all the
metals, semi-metals, planets, and distinguished philosophers."</p>
<p>"Very true, indeed, my dears, but you are blessed with wonderful
memories, and your poor cousin has probably none at all. There is a
vast deal of difference in memories, as well as in everything else;
and therefore you must make allowance for your cousin, and pity her
deficiency. And remember that if you are ever so forward and clever
yourselves, you should always be modest, for, much as you know
already, there is a great deal more for you to learn."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know there is, till I am seventeen. But I must tell you
another thing of Fanny, so odd and so stupid. Do you know, she says
she does not want to learn either music or drawing?"</p>
<p>"To be sure, my dear, that is very stupid indeed, and shows a
great want of genius and emulation. But, all things considered, I
do not know whether it is not as well that it should be so: for
though you know (owing to me) your papa and mamma are so good as to
bring her up with you, it is not at all necessary that she should
be as accomplished as you are; on the contrary, it is much more
desirable that there should be a difference."</p>
<p>Such were the counsels by which Mrs. Norris assisted to form her
nieces' minds; and it is not very wonderful that, with all their
promising talents and early information, they should be entirely
deficient in the less common acquirements of self-knowledge,
generosity, and humility. In everything but disposition, they were
admirably taught. Sir Thomas did not know what was wanting,
because, though a truly anxious father, he was not outwardly
affectionate, and the reserve of his manner repressed all the flow
of their spirits before him.</p>
<br>
<a name="AUSTEN_7"></a>
<h3>PRIVATE THEATRICALS</h3>
<center>From 'Mansfield Park'</center>
<p>Fanny looked on and listened, not unamused to observe the
selfishness which, more or less disguised, seemed to govern them
all, and wondering how it would end.</p>
<p>Three of the characters were now cast, besides Mr. Rushworth,
who was always answered for by Maria as willing to do anything;
when Julia, meaning, like her sister, to be Agatha, began to be
scrupulous on Miss Crawford's account.</p>
<p>"This is not behaving well by the absent," said she. "Here are
not women enough. Amelia and Agatha may do for Maria and me, but
here is nothing for your sister, Mr. Crawford."</p>
<p>Mr. Crawford desired <i>that</i> might not be thought of; he was
very sure his sister had no wish of acting but as she might be
useful, and that she would not allow herself to be considered in
the present case. But this was immediately opposed by Tom Bertram,
who asserted the part of Amelia to be in every respect the property
of Miss Crawford, if she would accept it. "It falls as naturally as
necessarily to her," said he, "as Agatha does to one or other of my
sisters. It can be no sacrifice on their side, for it is highly
comic."</p>
<p>A short silence followed. Each sister looked anxious; for each
felt the best claim to Agatha, and was hoping to have it pressed on
her by the rest. Henry Crawford, who meanwhile had taken up the
play, and with seeming carelessness was turning over the first act,
soon settled the business.</p>
<p>"I must entreat Miss <i>Julia</i> Bertram," said he, "not to
engage in the part of Agatha, or it will be the ruin of all my
solemnity. You must not, indeed you must not [turning to her]. I
could not stand your countenance dressed up in woe and paleness.
The many laughs we have had together would infallibly come across
me, and Frederick and his knapsack would be obliged to run
away."</p>
<p>Pleasantly, courteously, it was spoken; but the manner was lost
in the matter to Julia's feelings. She saw a glance at Maria, which
confirmed the injury to herself: it was a scheme, a trick; she was
slighted, Maria was preferred; the smile of triumph which Maria was
trying to suppress showed how well it was understood: and before
Julia could command herself enough to speak, her brother gave his
weight against her too, by saying, "Oh yes! Maria must be Agatha.
Maria will be the best Agatha. Though Julia fancies she prefers
tragedy, I would not trust her in it. There is nothing of tragedy
about her. She has not the look of it. Her features are not tragic
features, and she walks too quick, and speaks too quick, and would
not keep her countenance. She had better do the old
countrywoman--the Cottager's wife; you had, indeed, Julia.
Cottager's wife is a very pretty part, I assure you. The old lady
relieves the high-flown benevolence of her husband with a good deal
of spirit. You shall be the Cottager's wife."</p>
<p>"Cottager's wife!" cried Mr. Yates. "What are you talking of?
The most trivial, paltry, insignificant part; the merest
commonplace; not a tolerable speech in the whole. Your sister do
that! It is an insult to propose it. At Ecclesford the governess
was to have done it. We all agreed that it could not be offered to
anybody else. A little more justice, Mr. Manager, if you please.
You do not deserve the office if you cannot appreciate the talents
of your company a little better."</p>
<p>"Why, as to <i>that</i>, my good friends, till I and my company
have really acted, there must be some guesswork; but I mean no
disparagement to Julia. We cannot have two Agathas, and we must
have one Cottager's wife; and I am sure I set her the example of
moderation myself in being satisfied with the old Butler. If the
part is trifling she will have more credit in making something of
it: and if she is so desperately bent against everything humorous,
let her take Cottager's speeches instead of Cottager's wife's, and
so change the parts all through; <i>he</i> is solemn and pathetic
enough, I am sure. It could make no difference in the play; and as
for Cottager himself, when he has got his wife's speeches, <i>I</i>
would undertake him with all my heart."</p>
<p>"With all your partiality for Cottager's wife," said Henry
Crawford, "it will be impossible to make anything of it fit for
your sister, and we must not suffer her good nature to be imposed
on. We must not <i>allow</i> her to accept the part. She must not
be left to her own complaisance. Her talents will be wanted in
Amelia. Amelia is a character more difficult to be well represented
than even Agatha. I consider Amelia as the most difficult character
in the whole piece. It requires great powers, great nicety, to give
her playfulness and simplicity without extravagance. I have seen
good actresses fail in the part. Simplicity, indeed, is beyond the
reach of almost every actress by profession. It requires a delicacy
of feeling which they have not. It requires a gentlewoman--a Julia
Bertram. You <i>will</i> undertake it, I hope?" turning to her with
a look of anxious entreaty, which softened her a little; but while
she hesitated what to say, her brother again interposed with Miss
Crawford's better claim.</p>
<p>"No, no, Julia must not be Amelia. It is not at all the part for
her. She would not like it. She would not do well. She is too tall
and robust. Amelia should be a small, light, girlish, skipping
figure. It is fit for Miss Crawford, and Miss Crawford only. She
looks the part, and I am persuaded will do it admirably."</p>
<p>Without attending to this, Henry Crawford continued his
supplication. "You must oblige us," said he, "indeed you must. When
you have studied the character I am sure you will feel it suits
you. Tragedy may be your choice, but it will certainly appear that
comedy chooses <i>you</i>. You will have to visit me in prison with
a basket of provisions; you will not refuse to visit me in prison?
I think I see you coming in with your basket."</p>
<p>The influence of his voice was felt. Julia wavered; but was he
only trying to soothe and pacify her, and make her overlook the
previous affront? She distrusted him. The slight had been most
determined. He was, perhaps, but at treacherous play with her. She
looked suspiciously at her sister; Maria's countenance was to
decide it; if she were vexed and alarmed--but Maria looked all
serenity and satisfaction, and Julia well knew that on this ground
Maria could not be happy but at her expense. With hasty
indignation, therefore, and a tremulous voice, she said to him,
"You do not seem afraid of not keeping your countenance when I come
in with a basket of provisions--though one might have supposed--but
it is only as Agatha that I was to be so overpowering!" She
stopped, Henry Crawford looked rather foolish, and as if he did not
know what to say. Tom Bertram began again:--</p>
<p>"Miss Crawford must be Amelia. She will be an excellent
Amelia."</p>
<p>"Do not be afraid of <i>my</i> wanting the character," cried
Julia, with angry quickness: "I am <i>not</i> to be Agatha, and I
am sure I will do nothing else; and as to Amelia, it is of all
parts in the world the most disgusting to me. I quite detest her.
An odious little, pert, unnatural, impudent girl. I have always
protested against comedy, and this is comedy in its worst form."
And so saying, she walked hastily out of the room, leaving awkward
feelings to more than one, but exciting small compassion in any
except Fanny, who had been a quiet auditor of the whole, and who
could not think of her as under the agitations of <i>jealousy</i>
without great pity....</p>
<p>The inattention of the two brothers and the aunt to Julia's
discomposure, and their blindness to its true cause, must be
imputed to the fullness of their own minds. They were totally
preoccupied. Tom was engrossed by the concerns of his theatre, and
saw nothing that did not immediately relate to it. Edmund, between
his theatrical and his real part--between Miss Crawford's claims
and his own conduct--between love and consistency, was equally
unobservant: and Mrs. Norris was too busy in contriving and
directing the general little matters of the company, superintending
their various dresses with economical expedients, for which nobody
thanked her, and saving, with delighted integrity, half-a-crown
here and there to the absent Sir Thomas, to have leisure for
watching the behavior, or guarding the happiness, of his
daughters.</p>
<br>
<a name="AUSTEN_8"></a>
<h3>FRUITLESS REGRETS AND APPLES OF SODOM</h3>
<center>From 'Mansfield Park'</center>
<p>These were the circumstances and the hopes which gradually
brought their alleviation to Sir Thomas, deadening his sense of
what was lost, and in part reconciling him to himself; though the
anguish arising from the conviction of his own errors in the
education of his daughters was never to be entirely done away.</p>
<p>Too late he became aware how unfavorable to the character of any
young people must be the totally opposite treatment which Maria and
Julia had been always experiencing at home, where the excessive
indulgence and flattery of their aunt had been continually
contrasted with his own severity. He saw how ill he had judged, in
expecting to counteract what was wrong in Mrs. Norris by its
reverse in himself, clearly saw that he had but increased the evil,
by teaching them to repress their spirits in his presence so as to
make their real disposition unknown to him, and sending them for
all their indulgences to a person who had been able to attach them
only by the blindness of her affection and the excess of her
praise.</p>
<p>Here had been grievous mismanagement; but, bad as it was, he
gradually grew to feel that it had not been the most direful
mistake in his plan of education. Something must have been wanting
<i>within</i>, or time would have worn away much of its ill effect.
He feared that principle, active principle, had been wanting; that
they had never been properly taught to govern their inclinations
and tempers, by that sense of duty which can alone suffice. They
had been instructed theoretically in their religion, but never
required to bring it into daily practice. To be distinguished for
elegance and accomplishments--the authorized object of their
youth--could have had no useful influence that way, no moral effect
on the mind. He had meant them to be good, but his cares had been
directed to the understanding and manners, not the disposition; and
of the necessity of self-denial and humility, he feared they had
never heard from any lips that could profit them.</p>
<p>Bitterly did he deplore a deficiency which now he could scarcely
comprehend to have been possible. Wretchedly did he feel, that with
all the cost and care of an anxious and expensive education, he had
brought up his daughters without their understanding their first
duties, or his being acquainted with their character and
temper.</p>
<p>The high spirit and strong passions of Mrs. Rushworth especially
were made known to him only in their sad result. She was not to be
prevailed on to leave Mr. Crawford. She hoped to marry him, and
they continued together till she was obliged to be convinced that
such hope was vain, and till the disappointment and wretchedness
arising from the conviction rendered her temper so bad, and her
feelings for him so like hatred, as to make them for a while each
other's punishment, and then induce a voluntary separation.</p>
<p>She had lived with him to be reproached as the ruin of all his
happiness in Fanny, and carried away no better consolation in
leaving him, than that she <i>had</i> divided them. What can exceed
the misery of such a mind in such a situation!</p>
<p>Mr. Rushworth had no difficulty in procuring a divorce; and so
ended a marriage contracted under such circumstances as to make any
better end the effect of good luck, not to be reckoned on. She had
despised him, and loved another--and he had been very much aware
that it was so. The indignities of stupidity, and the
disappointments of selfish passion, can excite little pity. His
punishment followed his conduct, as did a deeper punishment the
deeper guilt of his wife. <i>He</i> was released from the
engagement, to be mortified and unhappy till some other pretty girl
could attract him into matrimony again, and he might set forward on
a second, and it is to be hoped more prosperous trial of the
state--if duped, to be duped at least with good humor and good
luck; while <i>she</i> must withdraw with infinitely stronger
feelings, to a retirement and reproach which could allow no second
spring of hope or character.</p>
<p>Where she could be placed, became a subject of most melancholy
and momentous consultation. Mrs. Norris, whose attachment seemed to
augment with the demerits of her niece, would have had her received
at home and countenanced by them all. Sir Thomas would not hear of
it; and Mrs. Norris's anger against Fanny was so much the greater,
from considering <i>her</i> residence there as the motive. She
persisted in placing his scruples to <i>her</i> account, though Sir
Thomas very solemnly assured her that had there been no young woman
in question, had there been no young person of either sex belonging
to him, to be endangered by the society or hurt by the character of
Mrs. Rushworth, he would never have offered so great an insult to
the neighborhood as to expect it to notice her. As a daughter--he
hoped a penitent one--she should be protected by him, and secured
in every comfort and supported by every encouragement to do right
which their relative situations admitted; but farther than
<i>that</i> he would not go. Maria had destroyed her own character;
and he would not, by a vain attempt to restore what never could be
restored, be affording his sanction to vice, or, in seeking to
lessen its disgrace, be anywise accessory to introducing such
misery in another man's family as he had known himself....</p>
<p>Henry Crawford, ruined by early independence and bad domestic
example, indulged in the freaks of a cold-blooded vanity a little
too long. Once it had, by an opening undesigned and unmerited, led
him into the way of happiness. Could he have been satisfied with
the conquest of one amiable woman's affections, could he have found
sufficient exultation in overcoming the reluctance, in working
himself into the esteem and tenderness of Fanny Price, there would
have been every probability of success and felicity for him. His
affection had already done something. Her influence over him had
already given him some influence over her. Would he have deserved
more, there can be no doubt that more would have been obtained;
especially when that marriage had taken place, which would have
given him the assistance of her conscience in subduing her first
inclination, and brought them very often together. Would he have
persevered, and uprightly, Fanny must have been his reward--and a
reward very voluntarily bestowed--within a reasonable period from
Edmund's marrying Mary. Had he done as he intended, and as he knew
he ought, by going down to Everingham after his return from
Portsmouth, he might have been deciding his own happy destiny. But
he was pressed to stay for Mrs. Fraser's party: his staying was
made of flattering consequence, and he was to meet Mrs. Rushworth
there. Curiosity and vanity were both engaged, and the temptation
of immediate pleasure was too strong for a mind unused to make any
sacrifice to right; he resolved to defer his Norfolk journey,
resolved that writing should answer the purpose of it, or that its
purpose was unimportant--and staid. He saw Mrs. Rushworth, was
received by her with a coldness which ought to have been repulsive,
and have established apparent indifference between them for ever:
but he was mortified, he could not bear to be thrown off by the
woman whose smiles had been so wholly at his command; he must exert
himself to subdue so proud a display of resentment: it was anger on
Fanny's account; he must get the better of it, and make Mrs.
Rushworth Maria Bertram again in her treatment of himself.</p>
<p>In this spirit he began the attack; and by animated perseverance
had soon re-established the sort of familiar intercourse--of
gallantry--of flirtation--which bounded his views: but in
triumphing over the discretion, which, though beginning in anger,
might have saved them both, he had put himself in the power of
feelings on her side more strong than he had supposed. She loved
him; there was no withdrawing attentions avowedly dear to her. He
was entangled by his own vanity, with as little excuse of love as
possible, and without the smallest inconstancy of mind towards her
cousin. To keep Fanny and the Bertrams from a knowledge of what was
passing became his first object. Secrecy could not have been more
desirable for Mrs. Rushworth's credit than he felt it for his own.
When he returned from Richmond, he would have been glad to see Mrs.
Rushworth no more. All that followed was the result of her
imprudence; and he went off with her at last because he could not
help it, regretting Fanny even at the moment, but regretting her
infinitely more when all the bustle of the intrigue was over, and a
very few months had taught him, by the force of contrast, to place
a yet higher value on the sweetness of her temper, the purity of
her mind, and the excellence of her principles.</p>
<p>That punishment, the public punishment of disgrace, should in a
just measure attend <i>his</i> share of the offense, is, we know,
not one of the barriers which society gives to virtue. In this
world, the penalty is less equal than could be wished; but without
presuming to look forward to a juster appointment hereafter, we may
fairly consider a man of sense, like Henry Crawford, to be
providing for himself no small portion of vexation and
regret--vexation that must rise sometimes to self-reproach, and
regret to wretchedness--in having so requited hospitality, so
injured family peace, so forfeited his best, most estimable, and
endeared acquaintance, and so lost the woman whom he had rationally
as well as passionately loved.</p>

<h2><a name="AVERRO"></a>AVERRO&Euml;S</h2>
<h3>(1126-1198)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-a.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>verro&euml;s (Abu 'l Walid Muhammad, ibn Achmad, ibn Muhammad,
IBN RUSHD; or more in English, Abu 'l Walid Muhammed, the son of
Achmet, the son of Muhammed, the son of Rushd) was born in 1126 at
Cordova, Spain. His father and grandfather, the latter a celebrated
jurist and canonist, had been judges in that city. He first studied
theology and canon law, and later medicine and philosophy; thus,
like Faust, covering the whole field of medi&aelig;al science. His
life was cast in the most brilliant period of Western Muslim
culture, in the splendor of that rationalism which preceded the
great darkness of religious fanaticism. As a young man, he was
introduced by Ibn Tufail (Abubacer), author of the famous 'Hayy
al-Yukdhan,' a philosophical 'Robinson Crusoe,' to the enlightened
Khalif Abu Ya'kub Yusuf (1163-84), as a fit expounder of the then
popular philosophy of Aristotle. This position he filled with so
much success as to become a favorite with the Prince, and finally
his private physician. He likewise filled the important office of
judge, first at Seville, later at Cordova.</p>
<p>He enjoyed even greater consideration under the next Khalif,
Ya'kub al-Mansur, until the year 1195, when the jealousy of his
rivals and the fanaticism of the Berbers led to his being accused
of championing philosophy to the detriment of religion. Though
Averro&euml;s always professed great respect for religion, and
especially for Islam, as a valuable popular substitute for science
and philosophy, the charge could hardly be rebutted (as will be
shown later), and the Amir of the Faithful could scarcely afford
openly to favor a heretic. Averro&euml;s was accordingly deprived
of his honors, and banished to Lacena, a Jewish settlement near
Cordova--a fact which gives coloring to the belief that he was of
Jewish descent. To satisfy his fanatical subjects for the moment,
the Khalif published severe edicts not only against Averro&euml;s,
but against all learned men and all learning as hostile to
religion. For a time the poor philosopher could not appear in
public without being mobbed; but after two years, a less fanatical
party having come into power, the Prince revoked his edicts, and
Averro&euml;s was restored to favor. This event he did not long
survive. He died on 10th December 1198, in Marocco. Here too he was
buried; but his body was afterward transported to Cordova, and laid
in the tomb of his fathers. He left several sons, more than one of
whom came to occupy important positions.</p>
<p>Averro&euml;s was the last great Muslim thinker, summing up and
carrying to its conclusions the thought of four hundred years. The
philosophy of Islam, which flourished first in the East, in Basra
and Bagdad (800-1100), and then in the West, Cordova, Toledo, etc.
(1100-1200), was a mixture of Aristotelianism and Neo-Platonism,
borrowed, under the earlier Persianizing Khalifs, from the
Christian (mainly Nestorian) monks of Syria and Mesopotamia, being
consequently a naturalistic system. In it God was acknowledged only
as the supreme abstraction; while eternal matter, law, and
impersonal intelligence played the principal part. It was
necessarily irreconcilable with Muslim orthodoxy, in which a
crudely conceived, intensely personal God is all in all. While
Persian influence was potent, philosophy flourished, produced some
really great scholars and thinkers, made considerable headway
against Muslim fatalism and predestination, and seemed in a fair
way to bring about a free and rational civilization, eminent in
science and art. But no sooner did the fanatical or scholastic
element get the upper hand than philosophy vanished, and with it
all hope of a great Muslim civilization in the East. This change
was marked by Al-Ghazzali, and his book 'The Destruction of the
Philosophers.' He died in A.D. 1111, and then the works of
Al-Farabi, Ibn-Sina, and the "Brothers of Purity," wandered out to
the far West, to seek for appreciation among the Muslim, Jews, and
Christians of Spain. And for a brief time they found it there, and
in the twelfth century found also eloquent expounders at the
mosque-schools of Cordova, Toledo, Seville, and Saragossa. Of these
the most famous were Ibn Baja, Ibn Tufail, and Ibn Rushd
(Averro&euml;s).</p>
<p>During its progress, Muslim philosophy had gradually been
eliminating the Neo-Platonic, mystic element, and returning to pure
Aristotelianism. In Averro&euml;s, who professed to be merely a
commentator on Aristotle, this tendency reached its climax; and
though he still regarded the pseudo-Aristotelian works as genuine,
and did not entirely escape their influence, he is by far the least
mystic of Muslim thinkers. The two fundamental doctrines upon which
he always insisted, and which long made his name famous, not to say
notorious, the eternity of matter and of the world (involving a
denial of the doctrine of creation), and the oneness of the active
intellect in all men (involving the mortality of the individual
soul and the impossibility of resurrection and judgment), are both
of Aristotelian origin. It was no wonder that he came into conflict
with the orthodox Muslim; for in the warfare between Arab
prophetism, with its shallow apologetic scholasticism, and Greek
philosophy, with its earnest endeavor to find truth, and its belief
in reason as the sole revealer thereof, he unhesitatingly took the
side of the latter. He held that man is made to discover truth, and
that the serious study of God and his works is the noblest form of
worship.</p>
<p>However little one may agree with his chief tenets, there can be
no doubt that he was the most enlightened man of the entire Middle
Age, in Europe at least; and if his spirit and work had been
continued, Western Isl&acirc;m might have become a great permanent
civilizing power. But here again, after a brief period of
extraordinary philosophic brilliancy, fanaticism got the upper
hand. With the death of Averro&euml;s the last hope of a beneficent
Muslim civilization came to an end. Since then, Islam has been a
synonym for blind fanaticism and cruel bigotry. In many parts of
the Muslim world, "philosopher" is a term of reproach, like
"miscreant."</p>
<p>But though Islam rejected its philosopher, Averro&euml;s's work
was by no means without its effect. It was through his commentaries
on Aristotle that the thought of that greatest of ancient thinkers
became known to the western world, both Jewish and Christian. Among
the Jews, his writings soon acquired almost canonical authority.
His system found expression in the works of the best known of
Hebrew thinkers, Maimonides (1135-1204), "the second Moses" works
which, despite all orthodox opposition, dominated Jewish thought
for nearly three hundred years, and made the Jews during that time
the chief promoters of rationalism. When Muslim persecution forced
a large number of Jews to leave Spain and settle in Southern
France, the works of Averro&euml;s and Maimonides were translated
into Hebrew, which thenceforth became the vehicle of Jewish
thought; and thus Muslim Aristotelianism came into direct contact
with Christianity.</p>
<p>Among the Christians, the works of Averro&euml;s, translated by
Michael Scott, "wizard of dreaded fame," Hermann the German, and
others, acted at once like a mighty solvent. Heresy followed in
their track, and shook the Church to her very foundations.
Recognizing that her existence was at stake, she put forth all her
power to crush the intruder. The Order of Preachers, initiated by
St. Dominic of Calahorra (1170-1221), was founded; the Inquisition
was legalized (about 1220). The writings of Aristotle and his Arab
commentators were condemned to the flames (1209, 1215, 1231).
Later, when all this proved unavailing, the best intellects in
Christendom, such as Albertus Magnus (1193-1280), and Thomas
Aquinas (1227-74), undertook to repel the new doctrine with its own
weapons; that is, by submitting the thought of Aristotle and his
Arab commentators to rational discussion. Thus was introduced the
second or palmy period of Christian Scholasticism, whose chief
industry, we may fairly say, was directed to the refutation of the
two leading doctrines of Averro&euml;s. Aiming at this, Thomas
Aquinas threw the whole dogmatic system of the Church into the
forms of Aristotle, and thus produced that colossal system of
theology which still prevails in the Roman Catholic world; witness
the Encyclical <i>&AElig;terni Patris</i> of Leo XIII., issued in
1879.</p>
<p>By the great thinkers of the thirteenth century, Averro&euml;s,
though regarded as heretical and dangerous in religion, was looked
up to as an able thinker, and the commentator <i>par
excellence</i>; so much so that St. Thomas borrowed from him the
very form of his own Commentaries, and Dante assigned him a
distinguished place, beside Plato and Aristotle, in the limbo of
ancient sages ('Inferno,' iv. 143). But in the following
century--mainly, no doubt, because he was chosen as the patron of
certain strongly heretical movements, such as those instigated by
the arch-rationalist Frederic II--he came to be regarded as the
precursor of Antichrist, if not that personage himself: being
credited with the awful blasphemy of having spoken of the founders
of the three current religions--Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad--as "the
three impostors." Whatever truth there may be in this, so much is
certain, that infidelity, in the sense of an utter disbelief in
Christianity as a revealed religion, or in any sense specially
true, dates from the thirteenth century, and is due in large
measure to the influence of Averro&euml;s. Yet he was a great
favorite with the Franciscans, and for a time exercised a profound
influence on the universities of Paris and Oxford, finding a strong
admirer even in Roger Bacon. His thought was also a powerful
element in the mysticism of Meister Eckhart and his followers; a
mysticism which incurred the censure of the Church.</p>
<p>Thus both the leading forms of heresy which characterized the
thirteenth century--naturalism with its tendency to magic,
astrology, alchemy, etc., etc., and mysticism with its dreams of
beatific visions, its self-torture and its lawlessness (see
G&ouml;rres, 'Die Christliche Mystik')--were due largely to
Averro&euml;s. In spite of this, his commentaries on Aristotle
maintained their credit, their influence being greatest in the
fourteenth century, when his doctrines were openly professed. After
the invention of printing, they appeared in numberless
editions,--several times in connection with the text of Aristotle.
As the age of the Renaissance and of Protestantism approached, they
gradually lost their prestige. The chief humanists, like Petrarch,
as well as the chief reformers, were bitterly hostile to them.
Nevertheless, they contributed important elements to both
movements.</p>
<p>Averroism survived longest in Northern Italy, especially in the
University of Padua, where it was professed until the seventeenth
century, and where, as a doctrine hostile to supernaturalism, it
paved the way for the study of nature and the rise of modern
science. Thus Averro&euml;s may fairly be said to have had a share
in every movement toward freedom, wise and unwise, for the last
seven hundred years. In truth, free thought in Europe owes more to
him than to any other man except Ab&eacute;lard. His last declared
follower was the impetuous Lucilio Vanini, who was burned for
atheism at Toulouse in 1619.</p>
<p>The best work on Averro&euml;s is Renan's 'Averro&euml;s et
l'Averro&iuml;sme' (fourth edition, Paris, 1893). This contains, on
pages 58-79, a complete list both of his commentaries and his
original writings.</p>

<h2>THE <a name="AVESTA"></a>AVESTA</h2>

<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-a.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>vesta, or Zend-Avesta, an interesting monument of antiquity, is
the Bible of Zoroaster, the sacred book of ancient Iran, and holy
scripture of the modern Parsis. The exact meaning of the name
"Avesta" is not certain; it may perhaps signify "law," "text," or,
more doubtfully, "wisdom," "revelation." The modern familiar
designation of the book as Zend-Avesta is not strictly accurate; if
used at all, it should rather be Avesta-Zend, like "Bible and
Commentary," as <i>zand</i> signifies "explanation," "commentary,"
and <i>Avesta u Zand</i> is employed in some Persian allusions to
the Zoroastrian scriptures as a designation denoting the text of
the Avesta accompanied by the Pahlavi version or
interpretation.</p>
<p>The story of the recovery of the Avesta, or rather the discovery
of the Avesta, by the enthusiastic young French scholar Anquetil du
Perron, who was the first to open to the western world the ancient
records of Zoroastrianism, reads almost like a romance. Du Perron's
own account of his departure for India in 1754, of his experiences
with the <i>dasturs</i> (or priests) during a seven years'
residence among them, of his various difficulties and annoyances,
setbacks and successes, is entertainingly presented in the
introductory volume of his work 'Zend-Avesta, Ouvrage de Zoroastre'
(3 Vols., Paris, 1771). This was the first translation of the
ancient Persian books published in a European language. Its
appearance formed one of those epochs which are marked by an
addition to the literary, religious, or philosophical wealth of our
time; a new contribution was added to the riches of the West from
the treasures of the East. The field thus thrown open, although
worked imperfectly at first, has yielded abundant harvests to the
hands of later gleaners.</p>

<i>THE ZEND-AVESTA.</i><br>

A.D. 1325. In the Royal Library at Copenhagen.<br>
<br>
The Zend-Avesta--more properly the Avesta-Zend, i.e., "Text and
Commentary"<br>
is the "Bible" of the Persians. The four parts into<br>
which it is divided are called Ya&ccedil;na, Vispered,<br>
Vendidad, and Khordah-Avesta.</p>
<br>
<p>With the growth of our knowledge of the language of the sacred
texts, we have now a clear idea also of the history of Zoroastrian
literature and of the changes and chances through which with
varying fortunes the scriptures have passed. The original
Zoroastrian Avesta, according to tradition, was in itself a
literature of vast dimensions. Pliny, in his 'Natural History,'
speaks of two million verses of Zoroaster; to which may be added
the Persian assertion that the original copy of the scriptures was
written upon twelve thousand parchments, with gold illuminated
letters, and was deposited in the library at Persepolis. But what
was the fate of this archetype? Parsi tradition has an answer.
Alexander the Great--"the accursed Iskander," as he is called--is
responsible for its destruction. At the request of the beautiful
Thais, as the story goes, he allowed the palace of Persepolis to be
burned, and the precious treasure perished in the flames. Whatever
view we may take of the different sides of this story, one thing
cannot be denied: the invasion of Alexander and the subjugation of
Iran was indirectly or directly the cause of a certain religious
decadence which followed upon the disruption of the Persian Empire,
and was answerable for the fact that a great part of the scriptures
was forgotten or fell into disuse. Persian tradition lays at the
doors of the Greeks the loss of another copy of the original
ancient texts, but does not explain in what manner this happened;
nor has it any account to give of copies of the prophet's works
which Semitic writers say were translated into nearly a dozen
different languages. One of these versions was perhaps Greek, for
it is generally acknowledged that in the fourth century B.C. the
philosopher Theopompus spent much time in giving in his own tongue
the contents of the sacred Magian books.</p>
<p>Tradition is unanimous on one point at least: it is that the
original Avesta comprised twenty-one <i>Nasks</i>, or books, a
statement which there is no good reason to doubt. The same
tradition which was acquainted with the general character of these
Nasks professes also to tell exactly how many of them survived the
inroad of Alexander; for although the sacred text itself was
destroyed, its contents were lost only in part, the priests
preserving large portions of the precious scriptures. These met
with many vicissitudes in the five centuries that intervened
between the conquest of Alexander and the great restoration of
Zoroastrianism in the third century of our era, under the Sassanian
dynasty. At this period all obtainable Zoroastrian scriptures were
collected, the compilation was codified, and a detailed notice made
of the contents of each of the original Nasks compared with the
portions then surviving. The original Avesta was, it would appear,
a sort of encyclopaedic work; not of religion alone, but of useful
knowledge relating to law, to the arts, science, the professions,
and to every-day life. If we may judge from the existing table of
contents of these Nasks, the zealous Sassanians, even in the time
of the collecting (A. D. 226-380), were able to restore but a
fragment of the archetype, perhaps a fourth part of the original
Avesta. Nor was this remnant destined to escape misfortune. The
Mohammedan invasion, in the seventh century of our era added a
final and crushing blow. Much of the religion that might otherwise
have been handed down to us, despite "the accursed Iskander's"
conquest, now perished through the sword and the Koran. Its loss,
we must remember, is in part compensated by the Pahlavi religious
literature of Sassanian days.</p>
<p>Fragmentary and disjointed as are the remnants of the Avesta, we
are fortunate in possessing even this moiety of the Bible of
Zoroaster, whose compass is about one tenth that of our own sacred
book. A grouping of the existing texts is here presented:--1. Yasna
(including Gathas). 2. Visperad. 3. Yashts. 4. Minor Texts. 5.
Vendidad. 6. Fragments.</p>
<p>Even these texts no single manuscript in our time contains
complete. The present collection is made by combining various
Avestan codexes. In spite of the great antiquity of the literature,
all the existing manuscripts are comparatively young. None is older
than the thirteenth century of our own era, while the direct
history of only one or two can be followed back to about the tenth
century. This mere external circumstance has of course no bearing
on the actual early age of the Zoroastrian scriptures. It must be
kept in mind that Zoroaster lived at least six centuries before the
birth of Christ.</p>
<p>Among the six divisions of our present Avesta, the Yasna,
Visperad, and Vendidad are closely connected. They are employed in
the daily ritual, and they are also accompanied by a version or
interpretation in the Pahlavi language, which serves at the same
time as a sort of commentary. The three divisions are often found
combined into a sort of prayer-book, called Vendidad-Sadah
(Vendidad Pure); i.e., Avesta text without the Pahlavi rendering.
The chapters in this case are arranged with special reference to
liturgical usage.</p>
<p>Some idea of the character of the Avesta as it now exists may be
derived from the following sketch of its contents and from the
illustrative selections presented:--</p>
<p>1. <i>Yasna</i> (sacrifice, worship), the chief liturgical work
of the sacred canon. It consists mainly of ascriptions of praise
and of prayer, and corresponds nearly to our idea of a prayer-book.
The Yasna comprises seventy-two chapters; these fall into three
nearly equal parts. The middle, or oldest part, is the section of
Gathas below described.</p>
<p>The meaning of the word <i>yasna</i> as above gives at once some
conception of the nature of the texts. The Yasna chapters were
recited at the sacrifice: a sacrifice that consisted not in
blood-offerings, but in an offering of praise and thanksgiving,
accompanied by ritual observances. The white-robed priest, girt
with the sacred cord and wearing a veil, the <i>paitidana</i>,
before his lips in the presence of the holy fire, begins the
service by an invocation of Ahura Mazda (Ormazd) and the heavenly
hierarchy; he then consecrates the <i>zaothra</i> water, the
<i>myazda</i> or oblation, and the <i>baresma</i> or bundle of
sacred twigs. He and his assistant now prepare the <i>haoma</i>
(the <i>soma</i> of the Hindus), or juice of a sacred plant, the
drinking of which formed part of the religious rite. At the ninth
chapter of the book, the rhythmical chanting of the praises of
Haoma is begun. This deified being, a personification of the
consecrated drink, is supposed to have appeared before the prophet
himself, and to have described to him the blessings which the
<i>haoma</i> bestows upon its pious worshiper. The lines are
metrical, as in fact they commonly are in the older parts of the
Avesta, and the rhythm somewhat recalls the Kalevala verse of
Longfellow's 'Hiawatha.' A specimen is here presented in
translation:--</p>

<p class="i6">Haoma came to Zoroaster,</p>
<p class="i6">Who was serving at the Fire</p>
<p class="i6">And the holy Psalms intoning.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">"What man art thou (asked the Prophet),</p>
<p class="i6">Who of all the world material</p>
<p class="i6">Art the fairest I have e'er seen</p>
<p class="i6">In my life, bright and immortal?"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The image of the sacred plant responds, and bids the priest
prepare the holy extract.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">Haoma then to me gave answer,</p>
<p class="i6">Haoma righteous, death-destroying:--</p>
<p class="i6">"Zoroaster, I am Haoma,</p>
<p class="i6">Righteous Haoma, death-destroying.</p>
<p class="i6">Do thou gather me, Spitama,</p>
<p class="i6">And prepare me as a potion;</p>
<p class="i6">Praise me, aye as shall hereafter</p>
<p class="i6">In their praise the Saviors praise me."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Zoroaster again inquires, wishing to know of the pious men of
old who worshiped Haoma and obtained blessings for their religious
zeal. Among these, as is learned from Haoma, one was King Yima,
whose reign was the time of the Golden Age; those were the happy
days when a father looked as young as his children.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">In the reign of princely Yima,</p>
<p class="i6">Heat there was not, cold there was not,</p>
<p class="i6">Neither age nor death existed,</p>
<p class="i6">Nor disease the work of Demons;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">Son and father walked together</p>
<p class="i6">Fifteen years old, each in figure,</p>
<p class="i6">Long as Vivanghvat's son Yima,</p>
<p class="i6">The good Shepherd, ruled as sovereign.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For two chapters more, Haoma is extolled. Then follows the
Avestan Creed (Yasna 12), a prose chapter that was repeated by
those who joined in the early Zoroastrian faith, forsook the old
marauding and nomadic habits that still characterize the modern
Kurds, and adopted an agricultural habit of life, devoting
themselves peaceably to cattle-raising, irrigation, and cultivation
of the fields. The greater part of the Yasna book is of a liturgic
or ritualistic nature, and need not here be further described.
Special mention, however, must be made of the middle section of the
Yasna, which is constituted by "the Five Gathas" (hymns, psalms), a
division containing the seventeen sacred psalms, sayings, sermons,
or teachings of Zoroaster himself. These Gathas form the oldest
part of the entire canon of the Avesta. In them we see before our
eyes the prophet of the new faith speaking with the fervor of the
Psalmist of the Bible. In them we feel the thrill of ardor that
characterizes a new and struggling religious band; we are warmed by
the burning zeal of the preacher of a church militant. Now,
however, comes a cry of despondency, a moment of faint-heartedness
at the present triumph of evil, at the success of the wicked and
the misery of the righteous; but this gives way to a clarion burst
of hopefulness, the trumpet note of a prophet filled with the
promise of ultimate victory, the triumph of good over evil. The end
of the world cannot be far away; the final overthrow of Ahriman
(Anra Mainyu) by Ormazd (Ahura Mazda) is assured; the establishment
of a new order of things is certain; at the founding of this
"kingdom" the resurrection of the dead will take place and the life
eternal will be entered upon.</p>
<p>The third Gatha, Yasna 30, may be chosen by way of illustration.
This is a sort of Mazdian Sermon on the Mount. Zoroaster preaches
the doctrine of dualism, the warfare of good and evil in the world,
and exhorts the faithful to choose aright and to combat Satan. The
archangels Good Thought (Vohu Manah), Righteousness (Asha), Kingdom
(Khshathra), appear as the helpers of Man (Maretan); for whose
soul, as in the old English morality play, the Demons (D&aelig;vas)
are contending. Allusions to the resurrection and final judgment,
and to the new dispensation, are easily recognized in the spirited
words of the prophet. A prose rendering of this metrical psalm is
here attempted; the verse order, however, is preserved, though
without rhythm.</p>

<br>
<p>The <i>Visperad</i> (all the masters) is a short collection of
prosaic invocations and laudations of sacred things. Its
twenty-four sections form a supplement to the Yasna. Whatever
interest this division of the Avesta possesses lies entirely on the
side of the ritual, and not in the field of literature. In this
respect it differs widely from the book of the Yashts, which is
next to be mentioned.</p>
<p>The <i>Yashts</i> (praises of worship) form a poetical book of
twenty-one hymns in which the angels of the religion, "the
worshipful ones" (<i>Yazatas, Izads</i>), are glorified, and the
heroes of former days. Much of the material of the Yashts is
evidently drawn from pre-Zoroastrian sagas which have been
remodeled and adopted, worked over and modified, and incorporated
into the canon of the new-founded religion. There is a mythological
and legendary atmosphere about the Yashts, and Firdausi's 'Shah
Nameh' serves to throw light on many of the events portrayed in
them, or allusions that would otherwise be obscure. All the longer
Yashts are in verse, and some of them have poetic merit. Chiefly to
be mentioned among the longer ones are: first, the one in praise of
Ardvi Sura Anahita, or the stream celestial (Yt. 5); second, the
Yasht which exalts the star Tishtrya and his victory over the demon
of drought (Yt. 8); then the one devoted to the Fravashis or
glorified souls of the righteous (Yt. 13) as well as the Yasht in
honor of Verethraghna, the incarnation of Victory (Yt. 14).
Selections from the others, Yt. 10 and Yt. 19, which are among the
noblest, are here given.</p>
<p>The first of the two chosen (Yt. 10) is dedicated to the great
divinity Mithra, the genius who presides over light, truth, and the
sun (Yt. 10, 13).</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">Foremost he, the celestial angel,</p>
<p class="i6">Mounts above Mount Hara (Alborz)</p>
<p class="i6">In advance of the sun immortal</p>
<p class="i6">Which is drawn by fleeting horses;</p>
<p class="i6">He it is, in gold adornment</p>
<p class="i6">First ascends the beauteous summits</p>
<p class="i6">Thence beneficent he glances</p>
<p class="i6">Over all the abode of Aryans.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As the god of light and of truth and as one of the judges of the
dead, he rides out in lordly array to the battle and takes an
active part in the conflict, wreaking vengeance upon those who at
any time in their life have spoken falsely, belied their oath, or
broken their pledge. His war-chariot and panoply are described in
mingled lines of verse and prose, which may thus be rendered (Yt.
10, 128-132):--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">By the side of Mithra's chariot,</p>
<p class="i6">Mithra, lord of the wide pastures,</p>
<p class="i6">Stand a thousand bows well-fashioned</p>
<p class="i6">(The bow has a string of cowgut).</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>By his chariot also are standing a thousand vulture-feathered,
gold-notched, lead-poised, well-fashioned arrows (the barb is of
iron); likewise a thousand spears well-fashioned and
sharp-piercing, and a thousand steel battle-axes, two-edged and
well-fashioned; also a thousand bronze clubs well-fashioned.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">And by Mithra's chariot also</p>
<p class="i6">Stands a mace, fair and well-striking,</p>
<p class="i6">With a hundred knobs and edges,</p>
<p class="i6">Dashing forward, felling heroes;</p>
<p class="i6">Out of golden bronze 'tis molded.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The second illustrative extract will be taken from Yasht 19,
which magnifies in glowing strains the praises of the Kingly Glory.
This "kingly glory" (<i>kavaem hvareno</i>) is a sort of halo,
radiance, or mark of divine right, which was believed to be
possessed by the kings and heroes of Iran in the long line of its
early history. One hero who bore the glory was the mighty warrior
Thraetaona (Feridun), the vanquisher of the serpent-monster Azhi
Dahaka (Zohak), who was depopulating the world by his fearful daily
banquet of the brains of two children. The victory was a glorious
triumph for Thraetaona (Yt. 19, 37):--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">He who slew Azhi Dahaka,</p>
<p class="i6">Three-jawed monster, triple-headed,</p>
<p class="i6">With six eyes and myriad senses,</p>
<p class="i6">Fiend demoniac, full of power,</p>
<p class="i6">Evil to the world, and wicked.</p>
<p class="i6">This fiend full of power, the Devil</p>
<p class="i6">Anra Mainyu had created,</p>
<p class="i6">Fatal to the world material,</p>
<p class="i6">Deadly to the world of Righteousness.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Of equal puissance was another noble champion, the valiant
Keresaspa, who dispatched a raging demon who, though not yet grown
to man's estate, was threatening the world. The monster's
thrasonical boasting is thus given (Yt. 19, 43):--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">I am yet only a stripling,</p>
<p class="i6">But if ever I come to manhood</p>
<p class="i6">I shall make the earth my chariot</p>
<p class="i6">And shall make a wheel of heaven.</p>
<p class="i6">I shall drive the Holy Spirit</p>
<p class="i6">Down from out the shining heaven,</p>
<p class="i6">I shall rout the Evil Spirit</p>
<p class="i6">Up from out the dark abysm;</p>
<p class="i6">They as steeds shall draw my chariot,</p>
<p class="i6">God and Devil yoked together.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Passing over a collection of shorter petitions, praises, and
blessings which may conveniently be grouped together as 'Minor
Prayers,' for they answer somewhat to our idea of a daily manual of
morning devotion, we may turn to the Vendidad (law against the
demons), the Iranian Pentateuch. Tradition asserts that in the
Vendidad we have preserved a specimen of one of the original Nasks.
This may be true, but even the superficial student will see that it
is in any case a fragmentary remnant. Interesting as the Vendidad
is to the student of early rites, observances, manners, and
customs, it is nevertheless a barren field for the student of
literature, who will find in it little more than wearisome
prescriptions like certain chapters of Leviticus, Numbers, and
Deuteronomy. It need only be added that at the close of the
colloquy between Zoroaster and Ormazd given in Vend. 6, he will
find the origin of the modern Parsi "Towers of Silence."</p>
<p>Among the Avestan Fragments, attention might finally be called
to one which we must be glad has not been lost. It is an old
metrical bit (Frag. 4, 1-3) in praise of the Airyama Ishya Prayer
(Yt. 54, 1). This is the prayer that shall be intoned by the Savior
and his companions at the end of the world, when the resurrection
will take place; and it will serve as a sort of last trump, at the
sound of which the dead rise from their graves and evil is banished
from the world. Ormazd himself says to Zoroaster (Frag. 4,
1-3):--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">The Airyama Ishya prayer, I tell thee,</p>
<p class="i6">Upright, holy Zoroaster,</p>
<p class="i6">Is the greatest of all prayers.</p>
<p class="i6">Verily among all prayers</p>
<p class="i6">It is this one which I gifted</p>
<p class="i6">With revivifying powers.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">This prayer shall the Saoshyants, Saviors,</p>
<p class="i6">Chant, and at the chanting of it</p>
<p class="i6">I shall rule over my creatures,</p>
<p class="i6">I who am Ahura Mazda.</p>
<p class="i6">Not shall Ahriman have power,</p>
<p class="i6">Anra Mainyu, o'er my creatures,</p>
<p class="i6">He (the fiend) of foul religion.</p>
<p class="i6">In the earth shall Ahriman hide,</p>
<p class="i6">In the earth the demons hide.</p>
<p class="i6">Up the dead again shall rise,</p>
<p class="i6">And within their lifeless bodies</p>
<p class="i6">Incorporate life shall be restored.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Inadequate as brief extracts must be to represent the sacred
books of a people, the citations here given will serve to show that
the Avesta which is still recited in solemn tones by the
white-robed priests of Bombay, the modern representatives of
Zoroaster, the Prophet of ancient days, is a survival not without
value to those who appreciate whatever has been preserved for us of
the world's earlier literature. For readers who are interested in
the subject there are several translations of the Avesta. The best
(except for the Gathas, where the translation is weak) is the
French version by Darmesteter, 'Le Zend Avesta,' published in the
'Annales du Mus&eacute;e Guimet' (Paris, 1892-93). An English
rendering by Darmesteter and Mills is contained in the 'Sacred
Books of the East,' Vols. iv., xxiii., xxxi.</p>

<h3>A PRAYER FOR KNOWLEDGE</h3>
<p>This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright: when praise is to be
offered, how shall I complete the praise of the One like You, O
Mazda? Let the One like Thee declare it earnestly to the friend who
is such as I, thus through Thy Righteousness within us to offer
friendly help to us, so that the One like Thee may draw near us
through Thy Good Mind within the Soul.</p>
<p>2. This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright how, in pleasing
Him, may we serve the Supreme One of the better world; yea, how to
serve that chief who may grant us those blessings of his grace and
who will seek for grateful requitals at our hands; for He,
bountiful as He is through the Righteous Order, will hold off ruin
from us all, guardian as He is for both the worlds, O Spirit Mazda!
and a friend.</p>
<p>3. This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright: Who by generation
is the first father of the Righteous Order within the world? Who
gave the recurring sun and stars their undeviating way? Who
established that whereby the moon waxes, and whereby she wanes,
save Thee? These things, O Great Creator! would I know, and others
likewise still.</p>
<p>4. This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright: Who from beneath
hath sustained the earth and the clouds above that they do not
fall? Who made the waters and the plants? Who to the wind has yoked
on the storm-clouds the swift and fleetest two? Who, O Great
Creator! is the inspirer of the good thoughts within our souls?</p>
<p>5. This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright: Who, as a skillful
artisan, hath made the lights and the darkness? Who, as thus
skillful, hath made sleep and the zest of waking hours? Who spread
the Auroras, the noontides and midnight, monitors to discerning
man, duty's true guides?</p>
<p>6. This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright these things which I
shall speak forth, if they are truly thus. Doth the Piety which we
cherish in reality increase the sacred orderliness within our
actions? To these Thy true saints hath she given the Realm through
the Good Mind? For whom hast thou made the Mother-kine, the produce
of joy?</p>
<p>7. This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright: Who fashioned
Aramaiti (our piety) the beloved, together with Thy Sovereign
Power? Who, through his guiding wisdom, hath made the son revering
the father? Who made him beloved? With questions such as these, so
abundant, O Mazda! I press Thee, O bountiful Spirit, Thou maker of
all!</p>

<h3>THE ANGEL OF DIVINE OBEDIENCE</h3>
<p>We worship Sraosha [Obedience] the blessed, whom four racers
draw in harness, white and shining, beautiful and (27) powerful,
quick to learn and fleet, obeying before speech, heeding orders
from the mind, with their hoofs of horn gold-covered, (28) fleeter
than [our] horses, swifter than the winds, more rapid than the rain
[drops as they fall]; yea, fleeter than the clouds, or well-winged
birds, or the well-shot arrow as it flies, (29) which overtake
these swift ones all, as they fly after them pursuing, but which
are never overtaken when they flee, which plunge away from both the
weapons [hurled on this side and on that] and draw Sraosha with
them, the good Sraosha and the blessed; which from both the weapons
[those on this side and on that] bear the good Obedience the
blessed, plunging forward in their zeal, when he takes his course
from India on the East and when he lights down in the West.</p>

<h3>TO THE FIRE</h3>
<p>I offer my sacrifice and homage to thee, the Fire, as a good
offering, and an offering with our hail of salvation, even as an
offering of praise with benedictions, to thee, the Fire, O Ahura,
Mazda's son! Meet for sacrifice art thou, and worthy of [our]
homage. And as meet for sacrifice, and thus worthy of our homage,
may'st thou be in the houses of men [who worship Mazda]. Salvation
be to this man who worships thee in verity and truth, with wood in
hand and baresma [sacred twigs] ready, with flesh in hand and
holding too the mortar. 2. And mayst thou be [ever] fed with wood
as the prescription orders. Yea, mayst thou have thy perfume
justly, and thy sacred butter without fail, and thine andirons
regularly placed. Be of full age as to thy nourishment, of the
canon's age as to the measure of thy food. O Fire, Ahura, Mazda's
son! 3. Be now aflame within this house; be ever without fail in
flame; be all ashine within this house: for long time be thou thus
to the furtherance of the heroic [renovation], to the completion of
[all] progress, yea, even till the good heroic [millennial] time
when that renovation shall have become complete. 4. Give me, O
Fire, Ahura, Mazda's son! a speedy glory, speedy nourishment and
speedy booty and abundant glory, abundant nourishment, abundant
booty, an expanded mind, and nimbleness of tongue and soul and
understanding, even an understanding continually growing in its
largeness, and that never wanders.</p>

<h3>THE GODDESS OF THE WATERS</h3>
<p>Offer up a sacrifice unto this spring of mine, Ardvi Sura
Anahita (the exalted, mighty, and undefiled, image of the (128)
stream celestial), who stands carried forth in the shape of a maid,
fair of body, most strong, tall-formed, high-girded, pure, nobly
born of a glorious race, wearing a mantle fully embroidered with
gold. 129. Ever holding the baresma in her hand, according to the
rules; she wears square golden ear-rings on her ears bored, and a
golden necklace around her beautiful neck, she, the nobly born
Ardvi Sura Anahita; and she girded her waist tightly, so that her
breasts may be well shaped, that they may be tightly pressed. 128.
Upon her head Ardvi Sura Anahita bound a golden crown, with a
hundred stars, with eight rays, a fine well-made crown, with
fillets streaming down. 129. She is clothed with garments of
beaver, Ardvi Sura Anahita; with the skin of thirty beavers, of
those that bear four young ones, that are the finest kind of
beavers; for the skin of the beaver that lives in water is the
finest colored of all skins, and when worked at the right time it
shines to the eye with full sheen of silver and gold.</p>

<h3>GUARDIAN SPIRITS</h3>
<p>We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis [guardian
spirits] of the faithful; with helms of brass, with weapons (45) of
brass, with armor of brass; who struggle in the fights for victory
in garments of light, arraying the battles and bringing them
forwards, to kill thousands of D&aelig;vas [demons]. 46. When the
wind blows from behind them and brings their breath unto men, then
men know where blows the breath of victory: and they pay pious
homage unto the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful,
with their hearts prepared and their arms uplifted. 47. Whichever
side they have been first worshiped in the fulness of faith of a
devoted heart, to that side turn the awful Fravashis of the
faithful along with Mithra [angel of truth and light] and Rashnu
[Justice] and the awful cursing thought of the wise and the
victorious wind.</p>

<h3>AN ANCIENT SINDBAD</h3>
<p>The manly-hearted Keresaspa was the sturdiest of the men of
strength, for Manly Courage clave unto him. We worship [this] Manly
Courage, firm of foot, unsleeping, quick to rise, and fully awake,
that clave unto Keresaspa [the hero], who killed the snake Srvara,

<h3>THE WISE MAN</h3>
<p>Verily I say it unto thee, O Spitama Zoroaster! the man who has
a wife is far above him who lives in continence; he who keeps a
house is far above him who has none; he who has children is far
above the childless man; he who has riches is far above him who has
none.</p>
<p>And of two men, he who fills himself with meat receives in him
good spirit [Vohu Mano] much more than he who does not do so; the
latter is all but dead; the former is above him by the worth of a
sheep, by the worth of an ox, by the worth of a man.</p>
<p>It is this man that can strive against the onsets of death; that
can strive against the well-darted arrow; that can strive against
the winter fiend with thinnest garment on; that can strive against
the wicked tyrant and smite him on the head; it is this man that
can strive against the ungodly fasting Ashemaogha [the fiends and
heretics who do not eat].</p>

<h2><a name="AVICEBRON"></a>AVICEBRON</h2>
<h3>(1028-? 1058)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-a.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>vicebron, or Avicebrol (properly Solomon ben Judah ibn Gabirol),
one of the most famous of Jewish poets, and the most original of
Jewish thinkers, was born at Cordova, in Spain, about A.D. 1028. Of
the events of his life we know little; and it was only in 1845 that
Munk, in the 'Literaturblatt des Orient,' proved the Jewish poet
Ibn Gabirol to be one and the same person with Avicebron, so often
quoted by the Schoolmen as an Arab philosopher. He was educated at
Saragossa, spent some years at Malaga, and died, hardly thirty
years old, about 1058. His disposition seems to have been rather
melancholy.</p>
<p>Of his philosophic works, which were written in Arabic, by far
the most important, and that which lent lustre to his name, was the
'Fountain of Life'; a long treatise in the form of a dialogue
between teacher and pupil, on what was then regarded as the
fundamental question in philosophy, the nature and relations of
Matter and Form. The original, which seems never to have been
popular with either Jews or Arabs, is not known to exist; but there
exists a complete Latin translation (the work having found
appreciation among Christians), which has recently been edited with
great care by Professor B&auml;umker of Breslau, under the title
'Avencebrolis Fons Vitae, ex Arabico in Latinum translatus ab
Johanne Hispano et Dominico Gundissalino' (M&uuml;nster, 1895).
There is also a series of extracts from it in Hebrew. Besides this,
he wrote a half-popular work, 'On the Improvement of Character,' in
which he brings the different virtues into relation with the five
senses. He is, further, the reputed author of a work 'On the Soul,'
and the reputed compiler of a famous anthology, 'A Choice of
Pearls,' which appeared, with an English translation by B.H.
Ascher, in London, in 1859. In his poetry, which, like that of
other medi&aelig;val Hebrew poets, Moses ben Ezra, Judah
Hal&eacute;vy, etc., is partly liturgical, partly worldly, he
abandons native forms, such as we find in the Psalms, and follows
artificial Arabic models, with complicated rhythms and rhyme,
unsuited to Hebrew, which, unlike Arabic, is poor in inflections.
Nevertheless, many of his liturgical pieces are still used in the
services of the synagogue, while his worldly ditties find admirers
elsewhere. (See A. Geiger, 'Ibn Gabirol und seine Dichtungen,'
Leipzig, 1867.)</p>
<p>The philosophy of Ibn Gabirol is a compound of Hebrew monotheism
and that Neo-Platonic Aristotelianism which for two hundred years
had been current in the Muslim schools at Bagdad, Basra, etc., and
which the learned Jews were largely instrumental in carrying to the
Muslims of Spain. For it must never be forgotten that the great
translators and intellectual purveyors of the Middle Ages were the
Jews. (See Steinschneider, 'Die Hebr&auml;ischen Uebersetzungen des
Mittelalters, und die Juden als Dolmetscher,' 2 vols., Berlin,
1893.)</p>
<p>The aim of Ibn Gabirol, like that of the other three noted
Hebrew thinkers, Philo, Maimonides, and Spinoza, was--given God, to
account for creation; and this he tried to do by means of
Neo-Platonic Aristotelianism, such as he found in the
Pseudo-Pythagoras, Pseudo-Empedocles, Pseudo-Aristotelian
'Theology' (an abstract from Plotinus), and 'Book on Causes' (an
abstract from Proclus's 'Institutio Theologica'). It is well known
that Aristotle, who made God a "thinking of thinking," and placed
matter, as something eternal, over against him, never succeeded in
bringing God into effective connection with the world (see K.
Elser, 'Die Lehredes Aristotles &uuml;ber das Wirken Gottes,'
M&uuml;nster, 1893); and this defect the Greeks never afterward
remedied until the time of Plotinus, who, without propounding a
doctrine of emanation, arranged the universe as a hierarchy of
existence, beginning with the Good, and descending through
correlated Being and Intelligence, to Soul or Life, which produces
Nature with all its multiplicity, and so stands on "the horizon"
between undivided and divided being. In the famous encyclopaedia of
the "Brothers of Purity," written in the East about A.D. 1000, and
representing Muslim thought at its best, the hierarchy takes this
form: God, Intelligence, Soul, Primal Matter, Secondary Matter,
World, Nature, the Elements, Material Things. (See Dieterici, 'Die
Philosophic der Araber im X. Jahrhundert n. Chr.,' 2 vols.,
Leipzig, 1876-79.) In the hands of Ibn Gabirol, this is transformed
thus: God, Will, Primal Matter, Form, Intelligence,
Soul--vegetable, animal, rational, Nature, the source of the
visible world. If we compare these hierarchies, we shall see that
Ibn Gabirol makes two very important changes: <i>first</i>, he
introduces an altogether new element, viz., the Will;
<i>second</i>, instead of placing Intelligence second in rank, next
to God, he puts Will, Matter, and Form before it. Thus, whereas the
earliest thinkers, drawing on Aristotle, had sought for an
explanation of the world in Intelligence, he seeks for it in Will,
thus approaching the standpoint of Schopenhauer. Moreover, whereas
they had made Matter and Form originate in Intelligence, he
includes the latter, together with the material world, among things
compounded of Matter and Form. Hence, everything, save God and His
Will, which is but the expression of Him, is compounded of Matter
and Form (cf. Dante, 'Paradiso,' i. 104 <i>seq</i>.). Had he
concluded from this that God, in order to occupy this exceptional
position, must be pure matter (or substance), he would have reached
the standpoint of Spinoza. As it is, he stands entirely alone in
the Middle Age, in making the world the product of Will, and not of
Intelligence, as the Schoolmen and the classical philosophers of
Germany held.</p>
<p>The 'Fountain of Life' is divided into five books, whose
subjects are as follows:--I. Matter and Form, and their various
kinds. II. Matter as the bearer of body, and the subject of the
categories. III. Separate Substances, in the created intellect,
standing between God and the World. IV. Matter and Form in simple
substances. V. Universal Matter and Universal Form, with a
discussion of the Divine Will, which, by producing and uniting
Matter and Form, brings being out of non-being, and so is the
'Fountain of Life.' Though the author is influenced by Jewish
cosmogony, his system, as such, is almost purely Neo-Platonic. It
remains one of the most considerable attempts that have ever been
made to find in spirit the explanation of the world; not only
making all matter at bottom one, but also maintaining that while
form is due to the divine will, matter is due to the divine
essence, so that both are equally spiritual. It is especially
interesting as showing us, by contrast, how far Christian thinking,
which rested on much the same foundation with it, was influenced
and confined by Christian dogmas, especially by those of the
Trinity and the Incarnation.</p>
<p>Ibn Gabirol's thought exerted a profound influence, not only on
subsequent Hebrew thinkers, like Joseph ben Saddig, Maimonides,
Spinoza, but also on the Christian Schoolmen, by whom he is often
quoted, and on Giordano Bruno. Through Spinoza and Bruno this
influence has passed into the modern world, where it still lives.
Dante, though naming many Arab philosophers, never alludes to Ibn
Gabirol; yet he borrowed more of his sublimest thoughts from the
'Fountain of Life' than from any other book. (Cf. Ibn Gabirol's
'Bedeutung f&uuml;r die Geschichte der Philosophie,' appendix to
Vol. i. of M. Jo&euml;l's 'Beitr&auml;ge zur Gesch. der Philos.,'
Breslau, 1876.) If we set aside the hypostatic form in which Ibn
Gabirol puts forward his ideas, we shall find a remarkable
similarity between his system and that of Kant, not to speak of
that of Schopenhauer. For the whole subject, see J. Guttman's 'Die
Philosophic des Salomon Ibn Gabirol' (G&ouml;ttingen, 1889).</p>

<h3>ON MATTER AND FORM</h3>
<center>From the 'Fountain of Life,' Fifth Treatise</center>
<p>Intelligence is finite in both directions: on the upper side, by
reason of will, which is above it; on the lower, by reason of
matter, which is outside of its essence. Hence, spiritual
substances are finite with respect to matter, because they differ
through it, and distinction is the cause of finitude; in respect to
forms they are infinite on the lower side, because one form flows
from another. And we must bear in mind that that part of matter
which is above heaven, the more it ascends from it to the principle
of creation, becomes the more spiritual in form, whereas that part
which descends lower than the heaven toward quiet will be more
corporeal in form. Matter, intelligence, and soul comprehend
heaven, and heaven comprehends the elements. And just as, if you
imagine your soul standing at the extreme height of heaven, and
looking back upon the earth, the earth will seem but a point, in
comparison with the heaven, so are corporeal and spiritual
substance in comparison with the will. And first matter is stable
in the knowledge of God, as the earth in the midst of heaven. And
the form diffused through it is as the light diffused through the
air....</p>
<p>We must bear in mind that the unity induced by the will (we
might say, the will itself) binds matter to form. Hence that union
is stable, firm, and perpetual from the beginning of its creation;
and thus unity sustains all things.</p>
<p>Matter is movable, in order that it may receive form, in
conformity with its appetite for receiving goodness and delight
through the reception of form. In like manner, everything that is,
desires to move, in order that it may attain something of the
goodness of the primal being; and the nearer anything is to the
primal being, the more easily it reaches this, and the further off
it is, the more slowly and with the longer motion and time it does
so. And the motion of matter and other substances is nothing but
appetite and love for the mover toward which it moves, as, for
example, matter moves toward form, through desire for the primal
being; for matter requires light from that which is in the essence
of will, which compels matter to move toward will and to desire it:
and herein will and matter are alike. And because matter is
receptive of the form that has flowed down into it by the flux of
violence and necessity, matter must necessarily move to receive
form; and therefore things are constrained by will and obedience in
turn. Hence by the light which it has from will, matter moves
toward will and desires it; but when it receives form, it lacks
nothing necessary for knowing and desiring it, and nothing remains
for it to seek for. For example, in the morning the air has an
imperfect splendor from the sun; but at noon it has a perfect
splendor, and there remains nothing for it to demand of the sun.
Hence the desire for the first motion is a likeness between all
substances and the first Maker, because it is impressed upon all
things to move toward the first; because particular matter desires
particular form, and the matter of plants and animals, which, in
generating, move toward the forms of plants and animals, are also
influenced by the particular form acting in them. In like manner
the sensible soul moves toward sensible forms, and the rational
soul to intelligible forms, because the particular soul, which is
called the first intellect, while it is in its principle, is
susceptible of form; but when it shall have received the form of
universal intelligence, which is the second intellect, and shall
become intelligence, then it will be strong to act, and will be
called the second intellect; and since particular souls have such a
desire, it follows that universal souls must have a desire for
universal forms. The same thing must be said of natural
matter,--that is, the substance which sustains the nine categories;
because this matter moves to take on the first qualities, then to
the mineral form, then to the vegetable, then to the sensible, then
to the rational, then to the intelligible, until at last it is
united to the form of universal intelligence. And this primal
matter desires primal form; and all things that are, desire union
and commixture, that so they may be assimilated to their principle;
and therefore, genera, species, differentiae, and contraries are
united through something in singulars.</p>
<p>Thus, matter is like an empty schedule and a wax tablet; whereas
form is like a painted shape and words set down, from which the
reader reaches the end of science. And when the soul knows these,
it desires to know the wonderful painter of them, to whose essence
it is impossible to ascend. Thus matter and form are the two closed
gates of intelligence, which it is hard for intelligence to open
and pass through, because the substance of intelligence is below
them, and made up of them. And when the soul has subtilized itself,
until it can penetrate them, it arrives at the word, that is, at
perfect will; and then its motion ceases, and its joy remains.</p>
<p>An analogy to the fact that the universal will actualizes
universal form in the matter of intelligence is the fact that the
particular will actualizes the particular form in the soul without
time, and life and essential motion in the matter of the soul, and
local motion and other motions in the matter of nature. But all
these motions are derived from the will; and so all things are
moved by the will, just as the soul causes rest or motion in the
body according to its will. And this motion is different according
to the greater or less proximity of things to the will. And if we
remove action from the will, the will will be identical with the
primal essence; whereas, with action, it is different from it.
Hence, will is as the painter of all forms; the matter of each
thing as a tablet; and the form of each thing as the picture on the
tablet. It binds form to matter, and is diffused through the whole
of matter, from highest to lowest, as the soul through the body;
and as the virtue of the sun, diffusing its light, unites with the
light, and with it descends into the air, so the virtue of the will
unites with the form which it imparts to all things, and descends
with it. On this ground it is said that the first cause is in all
things, and that there is nothing without it.</p>
<p>The will holds all things together by means of form; whence we
likewise say that form holds all things together. Thus, form is
intermediate between will and matter, receiving from will, and
giving to matter. And will acts without time or motion, through its
own might. If the action of soul and intelligence, and the infusion
of light are instantaneous, much more so is that of will.</p>
<p>Creation comes from the high creator, and is an emanation, like
the issue of water flowing from its source; but whereas water
follows water without intermission or rest, creation is without
motion or time. The sealing of form upon matter, as it flows in
from the will, is like the sealing or reflection of a form in a
mirror, when it is seen. And as sense receives the form of the felt
without the matter, so everything that acts upon another acts
solely through its own form, which it simply impresses upon that
other. Hence genus, species, differentia, property, accident, and
all forms in matter are merely an impression made by wisdom.</p>
<p>The created soul is gifted with the knowledge which is proper to
it; but after it is united to the body, it is withdrawn from
receiving those impressions which are proper to it, by reason of
the very darkness of the body, covering and extinguishing its
light, and blurring it, just as in the case of a clear mirror: when
dense substance is put over it its light is obscured. And therefore
God, by the subtlety of his substance, formed this world, and
arranged it according to this most beautiful order, in which it is,
and equipped the soul with senses, wherein, when it uses them, that
which is hidden in it is manifested in act; and the soul, in
apprehending sensible things, is like a man who sees many things,
and when he departs from them, finds that nothing remains with him
but the vision of imagination and memory.</p>
<p>We must also bear in mind that, while matter is made by essence,
form is made by will. And it is said that matter is the seat of
God, and that will, the giver of form, sits on it and rests upon
it. And through the knowledge of these things we ascend to those
things which are behind them, that is, to the cause why there is
anything; and this is a knowledge of the world of deity, which is
the greatest whole: whatever is below it is very small in
comparison with it.</p>

<h3>(1570-1638)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>his Scottish poet was born in his father's castle of Kinaldie,
near St. Andrews, Fifeshire, in 1570. He was descended from the
Norman family of De Vescy, a younger son of which settled in
Scotland and received from Robert Bruce the lands of Aytoun in
Berwickshire. Kincardie came into the family about 1539. Robert
Aytoun was educated at St. Andrews, taking his degree in 1588,
traveled on the Continent like other wealthy Scottish gentlemen,
and studied law at the University of Paris. Returning in 1603, he
delighted James I. by a Latin poem congratulating him on his
accession to the English throne. Thereupon the poet received an
invitation to court as Groom of the Privy Chamber. He rose rapidly,
was knighted in 1612, and made Gentleman of the Bedchamber to King
James and private secretary to Queen Anne. When Charles I. ascended
the throne, Aytoun was retained, and held many important posts.
According to Aubrey, "he was acquainted with all the witts of his
time in England." Sir Robert was essentially a court poet, and
belonged to the cultivated circle of Scottish favorites that James
gathered around him; yet there is no mention of him in the gossipy
diaries of the period, and almost none in the State papers. He
seems, however, to have been popular: Ben Jonson boasts that Aytoun
"loved me dearly." It is not surprising that his mild verses should
have faded in the glorious light of the contemporary poets.</p>
<p class="lft"><img src="images/image157.png" width="40%" alt=
""><br>
<b>ROBERT AYTOUN</b></p>
<p>He wrote in Greek and French, and many of his Latin poems were
published under the title 'Delitiae Poetarum Scotorum' (Amsterdam,
1637). His English poems on such themes as a 'Love Dirge,' 'The
Poet Forsaken,' 'The Lover's Remonstrance,' 'Address to an
Inconstant Mistress,' etc., do not show depth of emotion. He says
of himself:--</p>
<br>

<p class="i8">"Yet have I been a lover by report,</p>
<p class="i9">Yea, I have died for love as others do;</p>
<p class="i8">But praised be God, it was in such a sort</p>
<p class="i9">That I revived within an hour or two."</p>
</div>
</div>
<br>
<p>The lines beginning "I do confess thou'rt smooth and fair,"
quoted below with their adaptation by Burns, do not appear in his
MSS., collected by his heir Sir John Aytoun, nor in the edition of
his works with a memoir prepared by Dr. Charles Rogers, published
in Edinburgh in 1844 and reprinted privately in 1871. Dean Stanley,
in his 'Memorials of Westminster Abbey,' accords to him the
original of 'Auld Lang Syne,' which Rogers includes in his edition.
Burns's song follows the version attributed to Francis Temple.</p>
<p>Aytoun passed his entire life in luxury, died in Whitehall
Palace in 1638, and was the first Scottish poet buried in
Westminster Abbey. His memorial bust was taken from a portrait by
Vandyke.</p>

<p>ytoun the second, balladist, humorist, and Tory, in proportions
of about equal importance,--one of the group of wits and devotees
of the <i>status quo</i> who made Blackwood's Magazine so famous in
its early days,--was born in Edinburgh, June 21st, 1813. He was the
son of Roger Aytoun, "writer to the Signet"; and a descendant of
Sir Robert Aytoun (1570-1638), the poet and friend of Ben Jonson,
who followed James VI. from Scotland and who is buried in
Westminster Abbey. Both Aytoun's parents were literary. His mother,
who knew Sir Walter Scott, and who gave Lockhart many details for
his biography, helped the lad in his poems. She seemed to him to
know all the ballads ever sung. His earliest verses were praised by
Professor John Wilson ("Christopher North"), the first editor of
Blackwood's, whose daughter he married in 1849. At the age of
nineteen he published his 'Poland, Homer, and Other Poems'
(Edinburgh, 1832). After leaving the University of Edinburgh, he
studied law in London, visited Germany, and returning to Scotland,
was called to the bar in 1840. He disliked the profession, and used
to say that though he followed the law he never could overtake
it.</p>
<p>While in Germany he translated the first part of 'Faust' in
blank verse, which was never published. Many of his translations
from Uhland and Homer appeared in Blackwood's from 1836 to 1840,
and many of his early writings were signed "Augustus Dunshunner."
In 1844 he joined the editorial staff of Blackwood's, to which for
many years he contributed political articles, verse, translations
of Goethe, and humorous sketches. In 1845 he became Professor of
Rhetoric and Literature in the University of Edinburgh, a place
which he held until 1864. About 1841 he became acquainted with
Theodore Martin, and in association with him wrote a series of
light papers interspersed with burlesque verses, which, reprinted
from Blackwood's, became popular as the 'Bon Gaultier Ballads.'
Published in London in 1855, they reached their thirteenth edition
in 1877.</p>
<blockquote>"Some papers of a humorous kind, which I had published
under the <i>nom de plume</i> of Bon Gaultier," says Theodore
Martin in his 'Memoir of Aytoun,' "had hit Aytoun's fancy; and when
I proposed to go on with others in a similar vein, he fell readily
into the plan, and agreed to assist in it. In this way a kind of a
Beaumont-and-Fletcher partnership commenced in a series of humorous
papers, which appeared in Tait's and Fraser's magazines from 1842
to 1844. In these papers, in which we ran a-tilt, with all the
recklessness of youthful spirits, against such of the tastes or
follies of the day as presented an opening for ridicule or
mirth,--at the same time that we did not altogether lose sight of a
purpose higher than mere amusement,--appeared the verses, with a
few exceptions, which subsequently became popular, and to a degree
we then little contemplated, as the 'Bon Gaultier Ballads.' Some of
the best of these were exclusively Aytoun's, such as 'The Massacre
of the McPherson,' 'The Rhyme of Sir Launcelot Bogle,' 'The Broken
Pitcher,' 'The Red Friar and Little John,' 'The Lay of Mr. Colt,'
and that best of all imitations of the Scottish ballad, 'The Queen
in France.' Some were wholly mine, and the rest were produced by us
jointly. Fortunately for our purpose, there were then living not a
few poets whose style and manner of thought were sufficiently
marked to make imitation easy, and sufficiently popular for a
parody of their characteristics to be readily recognized.
Macaulay's 'Lays of Rome' and his two other fine ballads were still
in the freshness of their fame. Lockhart's 'Spanish Ballads' were
as familiar in the drawing-room as in the study. Tennyson and Mrs.
Browning were opening up new veins of poetry. These, with
Wordsworth, Moore, Uhland, and others of minor note, lay ready to
our hands,--as Scott, Byron, Crabbe, Coleridge, Wordsworth, and
Southey had done to James and Horace Smith in 1812, when writing
the 'Rejected Addresses.' Never, probably, were verses thrown off
with a keener sense of enjoyment."</blockquote>
<p>With Theodore Martin he published also 'Poems and Ballads of
Goethe' (London, 1858). Mr. Aytoun's fame as a poet rests on his
'Lays of the Cavaliers,' the themes of which are selected from
stirring incidents of Scottish history, ranging from Flodden Field
to the Battle of Culloden. The favorites in popular memory are 'The
Execution of Montrose' and 'The Burial March of Dundee.' This book,
published in London and Edinburgh in 1849, has gone through
twenty-nine editions.</p>
<p>His dramatic poem, 'Firmilian: a Spasmodic Tragedy,' written to
ridicule the style of Bailey, Dobell, and Alexander Smith, and
published in 1854, had so many excellent qualities that it was
received as a serious production instead of a caricature. Aytoun
introduced this in Blackwood's Magazine as a pretended review of an
unpublished tragedy (as with the 'Rolliad,' and as Lockhart had
done in the case of "Peter's Letters," so successfully that he had
to write the book itself as a "second edition" to answer the demand
for it). This review was so cleverly done that "most of the
newspaper critics took the part of the poet against the reviewer,
never suspecting the identity of both, and maintained the poetry to
be fine poetry and the critic a dunce." The sarcasm of 'Firmilian'
is so delicate that only those familiar with the school it is
intended to satirize can fairly appreciate its qualities. The drama
opens showing Firmilian in his study, planning the composition of
'Cain: a Tragedy'; and being infused with the spirit of the hero,
he starts on a career of crime. Among his deeds is the destruction
of the cathedral of Badajoz, which first appears in his mental
vision thus:--</p>
<blockquote>"Methought I saw the solid vaults give way,<br>
And the entire cathedral rise in air,<br>
As if it leaped from Pandemonium's jaws."</blockquote>
<p>To effect this he employs--</p>
<blockquote>"Some twenty barrels of the dusky grain<br>
The secret of whose framing in an hour<br>
Of diabolic jollity and mirth<br>
Old Roger Bacon wormed from Beelzebub."</blockquote>
<p>When the horror is accomplished, at a moment when the
inhabitants of Badajoz are at prayer, Firmilian rather enjoys the
scene:--</p>
<blockquote>"Pillars and altar, organ loft and screen,<br>
With a singed swarm of mortals intermixed,<br>
Whirling in anguish to the shuddering stars."</blockquote>
<p>"'Firmilian,'" to quote from Aytoun's biographer again,
"deserves to keep its place in literature, if only as showing how
easy it is for a man of real poetic power to throw off, in sport,
pages of sonorous and sparkling verse, simply by ignoring the
fetters of nature and common-sense and dashing headlong on Pegasus
through the wilderness of fancy." Its extravagances of rhetoric can
be imagined from the following brief extract, somewhat reminiscent
of Marlowe:--</p>
<blockquote>"And shall I then take Celsus for my guide,<br>
Confound my brain with dull Justinian tomes,<br>
Or stir the dust that lies o'er Augustine?<br>
Not I, in faith! I've leaped into the air,<br>
And clove my way through ether like a bird<br>
That flits beneath the glimpses of the moon,<br>
Right eastward, till I lighted at the foot<br>
Of holy Helicon, and drank my fill<br>
At the clear spout of Aganippe's stream;<br>
I've rolled my limbs in ecstasy along<br>
The selfsame turf on which old Homer lay<br>
That night he dreamed of Helen and of Troy:<br>
And I have heard, at midnight, the sweet strains<br>
Come quiring from the hilltop, where, enshrined<br>
In the rich foldings of a silver cloud,<br>
The Muses sang Apollo into sleep."</blockquote>
<p>In 1856 was printed 'Bothwell,' a poetic monologue on Mary
Stuart's lover. Of Aytoun's humorous sketches, the most humorous
are 'My First Spec in the Biggleswades,' and 'How We Got Up the
Glen Mutchkin Railway'; tales written during the railway mania of
1845, which treat of the folly and dishonesty of its promoters, and
show many typical Scottish characters. His 'Ballads of Scotland'
was issued in 1858; it is an edition of the best ancient
minstrelsy, with preface and notes. In 1861 appeared 'Norman
Sinclair,' a novel published first in Blackwood's, and giving
interesting pictures of society in Scotland and personal
experiences.</p>
<p>After Professor Wilson's death, Aytoun was considered the
leading man of letters in Scotland; a rank which he modestly
accepted by writing in 1838 to a friend:--"I am getting a kind of
fame as the literary man of Scotland. Thirty years ago, in the
North countries, a fellow achieved an immense reputation as 'The
Tollman,' being the solitary individual entitled by law to levy
blackmail at a ferry." In 1860 he was made Honorary President of
the Associated Societies of the University of Edinburgh, his
competitor being Thackeray. This was the place held afterward by
Lord Lytton, Sir David Brewster, Carlyle, and Gladstone. Aytoun
wrote the 'The Life and Times of Richard the First' (London, 1840),
and in 1863 a 'Nuptial Ode on the Marriage of the Prince of
Wales.'</p>
<p>Aytoun was a man of great charm and geniality in society; even
to Americans, though he detested America with the energy of
fear--the fear of all who see its prosperity sapping the
foundations of their class society. He died in 1865; and in 1867
his biography was published by Sir Theodore Martin, his
collaborator. Martin's definition of Aytoun's place in literature
is felicitous:--</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>"Fashions in poetry may alter, but so long as the themes with
which they deal have an interest for his countrymen, his 'Lays'
will find, as they do now, a wide circle of admirers. His powers as
a humorist were perhaps greater than as a poet. They have certainly
been more widely appreciated. His immediate contemporaries owe him
much, for he has contributed largely to that kindly mirth without
which the strain and struggle of modern life would be intolerable.
Much that is excellent in his humorous writings may very possibly
cease to retain a place in literature from the circumstance that he
deals with characters and peculiarities which are in some measure
local, and phases of life and feeling and literature which are more
or less ephemeral. But much will certainly continue to be read and
enjoyed by the sons and grandsons of those for whom it was
originally written; and his name will be coupled with those of
Wilson, Lockhart, Sydney Smith, Peacock, Jerrold, Mahony, and Hood,
as that of a man gifted with humor as genuine and original as
theirs, however opinions may vary as to the order of their relative
merits."</p>

<h3>A BALL IN THE UPPER CIRCLES</h3>
<center>From "The Modern Endymion"</center>
<p>'Twas a hot season in the skies. Sirius held the ascendant, and
under his influence even the radiant band of the Celestials began
to droop, while the great ball-room of Olympus grew gradually more
and more deserted. For nearly a week had Orpheus, the leader of the
heavenly orchestra, played to a deserted floor. The
<i>&eacute;lite</i> would no longer figure in the waltz.</p>
<p>Juno obstinately kept her room, complaining of headache and
ill-temper. Ceres, who had lately joined a dissenting congregation,
objected generally to all frivolous amusements; and Minerva had
established, in opposition, a series of literary soirees, at which
Pluto nightly lectured on the fine arts and phrenology, to a
brilliant and fashionable audience. The Muses, with Hebe and some
of the younger deities, alone frequented the assemblies; but with
all their attractions there was still a sad lack of partners. The
younger gods had of late become remarkably dissipated, messed three
times a week at least with Mars in the barracks, and seldom
separated sober. Bacchus had been sent to Coventry by the ladies,
for appearing one night in the ball-room, after a hard sederunt, so
drunk that he measured his length upon the floor after a vain
attempt at a mazurka; and they likewise eschewed the company of
Pan, who had become an abandoned smoker, and always smelt
infamously of cheroots. But the most serious defection, as also the
most unaccountable, was that of the beautiful Diana, <i>par
excellence</i> the belle of the season, and assuredly the most
graceful nymph that ever tripped along the halls of heaven. She had
gone off suddenly to the country, without alleging any intelligible
excuse, and with her the last attraction of the ball-room seemed to
have disappeared. Even Venus, the perpetual lady patroness, saw
that the affair was desperate.</p>
<p>"Ganymede, <i>mon beau garcon</i>," said she, one evening at an
unusually thin assembly, "we must really give it up at last.
Matters are growing worse and worse, and in another week we shall
positively not have enough to get up a tolerable gallopade. Look at
these seven poor Muses sitting together on the sofa. Not a soul has
spoken to them to-night, except that horrid Silenus, who dances
nothing but Scotch reels."</p>
<p>"<i>Pardieu!</i>" replied the young Trojan, fixing his glass in
his eye. "There may be a reason for that. The girls are decidedly
<i>pass&eacute;es</i>, and most inveterate blues. But there's dear
little Hebe, who never wants partners, though that clumsy Hercules
insists upon his conjugal rights, and keeps moving after her like
an enormous shadow. 'Pon my soul, I've a great mind--Do you think,
<i>ma belle tante</i>, that anything might be done in that
quarter?"</p>
<p>"Oh fie, Ganymede--fie for shame!" said Flora, who was sitting
close to the Queen of Love, and overheard the conversation. "You
horrid, naughty man, how can you talk so?"</p>
<p>"<i>Pardon, ma ch&egrave;re</i>!" replied the exquisite with a
languid smile. "You must excuse my <i>badinage</i>; and indeed, a
glance of your fair eyes were enough at any time to recall me to my
senses. By the way, what a beautiful <i>bouquet</i> you have there.
<i>Parole d'honneur</i>, I am quite jealous. May I ask who sent
it?"</p>
<p>"What a goose you are!" said Flora, in evident confusion: "how
should I know? Some general admirer like yourself, I suppose."</p>
<p>"Apollo is remarkably fond of hyacinths, I believe," said
Ganymede, looking significantly at Venus. "Ah, well! I see how it
is. We poor detrimentals must break our hearts in silence. It is
clear we have no chance with the <i>preux chevalier</i> of
heaven."</p>
<p>"Really, Ganymede, you are very severe this evening," said Venus
with a smile; "but tell me, have you heard anything of Diana?"</p>
<p>"Ah! <i>la belle Diane</i>? They say she is living in the
country somewhere about Caria, at a place they call Latmos Cottage,
cultivating her faded roses--what a color Hebe has!--and studying
the sentimental."</p>
<p>"<i>Tant pis</i>! She is a great loss to us," said Venus.
"Apropos, you will be at Neptune's <i>f&ecirc;te
champ&eacute;tre</i> to-morrow, <i>n'est ce pas?</i> We shall then
finally determine about abandoning the assemblies. But I must go
home now. The carriage has been waiting this hour, and my doves may
catch cold. I suppose that boy Cupid will not be home till all
hours of the morning."</p>
<p>"Why, I believe the Rainbow Club <i>does</i> meet to-night,
after the dancing," said Ganymede significantly. "This is the last
oyster-night of the season."</p>
<p>"Gracious goodness! The boy will be quite tipsy," said Venus.
"Do, dear Ganymede! try to keep him sober. But now, give me your
arm to the cloak-room."</p>
<p>"<i>Volontiers</i>!" said the exquisite.</p>
<p>As Venus rose to go, there was a rush of persons to the further
end of the room, and the music ceased. Presently, two or three
voices were heard calling for Aesculapius.</p>
<p>"What's the row?" asked that learned individual, advancing
leisurely from the refreshment table, where he had been cramming
himself with tea and cakes.</p>
<p>"Leda's fainted!" shrieked Calliope, who rushed past with her
vinaigrette in hand.</p>
<p>"<i>Gammon</i>!" growled the Abernethy of heaven, as he followed
her.</p>
<p>"Poor Leda!" said Venus, as her cavalier adjusted her shawl.
"These fainting fits are decidedly alarming. I hope it is nothing
more serious than the weather."</p>
<p>"I hope so, too," said Ganymede. "Let me put on the scarf. But
people will talk. Pray heaven it be not a second edition of that
old scandal about the eggs!"</p>
<p>"<i>Fi done</i>! You odious creature! How can you? But after
all, stranger things have happened. There now, have done.
Good-night!" and she stepped into her chariot.</p>
<p>"<i>Bon soir</i>" said the exquisite, kissing his hand as it
rolled away. "'Pon my soul, that's a splendid woman. I've a great
mind--but there's no hurry about that. <i>Revenons &agrave; nos
oeufs.</i> I must learn something more about this fainting fit." So
saying, Ganymede re-ascended the stairs.</p>

<h3>A HIGHLAND TRAMP</h3>
<center>From 'Norman Sinclair'</center>
<p>When summer came--for in Scotland, alas! there is no spring,
winter rolling itself remorselessly, like a huge polar bear, over
what should be the beds of the early flowers, and crushing them ere
they develop--when summer came, and the trees put on their
pale-green liveries, and the brakes were blue with the
wood-hyacinth, and the ferns unfolded their curl, what ecstasy it
was to steal an occasional holiday, and wander, rod in hand, by
some quiet stream up in the moorlands, inhaling health from every
breeze, nor seeking shelter from the gentle shower as it dropped
its manna from the heavens! And then the long holidays, when the
town was utterly deserted--how I enjoyed these, as they can only be
enjoyed by the possess-ors of the double talisman of strength and
youth! No more care--no more trouble--no more task-work--no thought
even of the graver themes suggested by my later studies!
Look--standing on the Calton Hill, behold yon blue range of
mountains to the west--cannot you name each pinnacle from its form?
Benledi, Benvoirlich, Benlomond! Oh, the beautiful land, the
elysium that lies round the base of those distant giants! The
forest of Glenfinlas, Loch Achray with its weeping birches, the
grand defiles of the Trosachs, and Ellen's Isle, the pearl of the
one lake that genius has forever hallowed! Up, sluggard! Place your
knapsack on your back; but stow it not with unnecessary gear, for
you have still further to go, and your rod also must be your
companion, if you mean to penetrate the region beyond. Money?
Little money suffices him who travels on foot, who can bring his
own fare to the shepherd's bothy where he is to sleep, and who
sleeps there better and sounder than the tourist who rolls from
station to station in his barouche, grumbling because the hotels
are overcrowded, and miserable about the airing of his sheets.
Money? You would laugh if you heard me mention the sum which has
sufficed for my expenditure during a long summer month; for the
pedestrian, humble though he be, has his own especial privileges,
and not the least of these is that he is exempted from all
extortion. Donald--God bless him!--has a knack of putting on the
prices; and when an English family comes posting up to the door of
his inn, clamorously demanding every sort of accommodation which a
metropolitan hotel could afford, grumbling at the lack of
attendance, sneering at the quality of the food, and turning the
whole establishment upside down for their own selfish
gratification, he not unreasonably determines that the extra
trouble shall be paid for in that gold which rarely crosses his
fingers except during the short season when tourists and sportsmen
abound. But Donald, who is descended from the M'Gregor, does not
make spoil of the poor. The sketcher or the angler who come to his
door, with the sweat upon their brow and the dust of the highway or
the pollen of the heather on their feet, meet with a hearty
welcome; and though the room in which their meals are served is but
low in the roof, and the floor strewn with sand, and the attic
wherein they lie is garnished with two beds and a shake-down, yet
are the viands wholesome, the sheets clean, and the tariff so
undeniably moderate that even parsimony cannot complain. So up in
the morning early, so soon as the first beams of the sun slant into
the chamber--down to the loch or river, and with a headlong plunge
scrape acquaintance with the pebbles at the bottom; then rising
with a hearty gasp, strike out for the islet or the further bank,
to the astonishment of the otter, who, thief that he is, is
skulking back to his hole below the old saugh-tree, from a midnight
foray up the burns. Huzza! The mallard, dozing among the reeds, has
taken fright, and tucking up his legs under his round fat rump,
flies quacking to a remoter marsh.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"By the pricking of my thumbs,<br>
Something wicked this way comes,"<br>
<p>and lo! Dugald the keeper, on his way to the hill, is arrested
by the aquatic phenomenon, and half believes that he is witnessing
the frolics of an Urisk! Then make your toilet on the green-sward,
swing your knapsack over your shoulders, and cover ten good miles
of road before you halt before breakfast with more than the
appetite of an ogre.</p>
<p>In this way I made the circuit of well-nigh the whole of the
Scottish Highlands, penetrating as far as Cape Wrath and the wild
district of Edderachylis, nor leaving unvisited the grand scenery
of Loch Corruisk, and the stormy peaks of Skye; and more than one
delightful week did I spend each summer, exploring Gameshope, or
the Linns of Talla, where the Covenanters of old held their
gathering; or clambering up the steep ascent by the Grey Mare's
Tail to lonely and lovely Loch Skene, or casting for trout in the
silver waters of St. Mary's.</p>

<h2>MASSIMO TAPARELLI D'<a name="AZEGLIO"></a>AZEGLIO</h2>
<h3>(1798-1866)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-m.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>assimo Taparelli, Marquis d'Azeglio, like his greater colleague
and sometime rival in the Sardinian Ministry, Cavour, wielded a
graceful and forcible pen, and might have won no slight distinction
in the peaceful paths of literature and art as well, had he not
been before everything else a patriot. Of ancient and noble
Piedmontese stock, he was born at Turin in October, 1798. In his
fifteenth year the youth accompanied his father to Rome, where the
latter had been appointed ambassador, and thus early he was
inspired with the passion for painting and music which never left
him. In accordance with the paternal wish he entered on a military
career, but soon abandoned the service to devote himself to art.
But after a residence of eight years (1821-29) in the papal
capital, having acquired both skill and fame as a landscape
painter, D'Azeglio began to direct his thoughts to letters and
politics.</p>
<p>After the death of his father in 1830 he settled in Milan, where
he formed the acquaintance of the poet and novelist Alessandro
Manzoni, whose daughter he married, and under whose influence he
became deeply interested in literature, especially in its relation
to the political events of those stirring times. The agitation
against Austrian domination was especially marked in the north of
Italy, where Manzoni had made himself prominent; and so it came to
pass that Massimo d'Azeglio plunged into literature with the ardent
hope of stimulating the national sense of independence and
unity.</p>
<p>In 1833 he published, not without misgivings, 'Ettore
Fieramosca,' his first romance, in which he aimed to teach Italians
how to fight for national honor. The work achieved an immediate and
splendid success, and unquestionably served as a powerful aid to
the awakening of Italy's ancient patriotism. It was followed in
1841 by 'Nicolo de' Lapi,' a story conceived in similar vein, with
somewhat greater pretensions to literary finish. D'Azeglio now
became known as one of the foremost representatives of the moderate
party, and exerted the potent influence of his voice as well as of
his pen in diffusing liberal propaganda. In 1846 he published the
bold pamphlet 'Gli Ultimi Casi di Romagna' (On the Recent Events in
Romagna), in which he showed the danger and utter futility of
ill-advised republican outbreaks, and the paramount necessity of
adopting thereafter a wiser and more practical policy to gain the
great end desired. Numerous trenchant political articles issued
from his pen during the next two years. The year 1849 found him a
member of the first Sardinian parliament, and in March of that year
Victor Emmanuel called him to the presidency of the Council with
the portfolio of Foreign Affairs. Obliged to give way three years
later before the rising genius of Cavour, he served his country
with distinction on several important diplomatic missions after the
peace of Villafranca, and died in his native city on the 15th of
January, 1866.</p>
<p>In 1867 appeared D'Azeglio's autobiography, 'I Miei Ricordi,'
translated into English by Count Maffei under title of 'My
Recollections' which is undeniably the most interesting and
thoroughly delightful product of his pen. "He was a 'character,'"
said an English critic at the time: "a man of whims and oddities,
of hobbies and crotchets.... This character of individuality, which
impressed its stamp on his whole life, is charmingly revealed in
every sentence of the memoirs which he has left behind him; so
that, more than any of his previous writings, their mingled
homeliness and wit and wisdom justify the epithet which I once
before ventured to give him when I described him as 'the Giusti of
Italian prose.'" As a polemic writer D'Azeglio was recognized as
one of the chief forces in molding public opinion. If he had not
been both patriot and statesman, this versatile genius, as before
intimated, would not improbably have gained an enviable reputation
in the realm of art; and although his few novels are--perhaps with
justice--no longer remembered, they deeply stirred the hearts of
his countrymen in their day, and to say the least are characterized
by good sense, facility of execution, and a refined imaginative
power.</p>
<br>
<a name="AZEGLIO_1"></a>
<h3>A HAPPY CHILDHOOD</h3>
<center>From 'My Recollections'</center>
<p>The distribution of our daily occupations was strictly laid down
for Matilde and me in black and white, and these rules were not to
be broken with impunity. We were thus accustomed to habits of
order, and never to make anybody wait for our convenience; a fault
which is one of the most troublesome that can be committed either
by great people or small.</p>
<p>I remember one day that Matilde, having gone out with Teresa,
came home when we had been at dinner some time. It was winter, and
snow was falling. The two culprits sat down a little confused, and
their soup was brought them in two plates, which had been kept hot;
but can you guess where? On the balcony; so that the contents were
not only below freezing-point, but actually had a thick covering of
snow!</p>
<p>At dinner, of course my sister and I sat perfectly silent,
waiting our turn, without right of petition or remonstrance. As to
the other proprieties of behavior, such as neatness, and not being
noisy or boisterous, we knew well that the slightest infraction
would have entailed banishment for the rest of the day at least.
Our great anxiety was to eclipse ourselves as much as possible; and
I assure you that under this system we never fancied ourselves the
central points of importance round which all the rest of the world
was to revolve,--an idea which, thanks to absurd indulgence and
flattery, is often forcibly thrust, I may say, into poor little
brains, which if left to themselves would never have lost their
natural simplicity.</p>
<p>The lessons of 'Galateo' were not enforced at dinner only. Even
at other times we were forbidden to raise our voices or interrupt
the conversation of our elders, still more to quarrel with each
other. If sometimes as we went to dinner I rushed forward before
Matilde, my father would take me by the arm and make me come last,
saying, "There is no need to be uncivil because she is your
sister." The old generation in many parts of Italy have the habit
of shouting and raising their voices as if their interlocutor were
deaf, interrupting him as if he had no right to speak, and poking
him in the ribs and otherwise, as if he could only be convinced by
sensations of bodily pain. The regulations observed in my family
were therefore by no means superfluous; and would to Heaven they
were universally adopted as the law of the land!</p>
<p>On another occasion my excellent mother gave me a lesson of
humility, which I shall never forget any more than the place where
I received it.</p>
<p>In the open part of the Cascine, which was once used as a
race-course, to the right of the space where the carriages stand,
there is a walk alongside the wood. I was walking there one day
with my mother, followed by an old servant, a countryman of
Pylades; less heroic than the latter, but a very good fellow too. I
forget why, but I raised a little cane I had in my hand, and I am
afraid I struck him. My mother, before all the passers-by, obliged
me to kneel down and beg his pardon. I can still see poor Giacolin
taking off his hat with a face of utter bewilderment, quite unable
to comprehend how it was that the Chevalier Massimo Taparelli
d'Azeglio came to be at his feet.</p>
<p>An indifference to bodily pain was another of the precepts most
carefully instilled by our father; and as usual, the lesson was
made more impressive by example whenever an opportunity presented
itself. If, for instance, we complained of any slight pain or
accident, our father used to say, half in fun, half in earnest,
"When a Piedmontese has both his arms and legs broken, and has
received two sword-thrusts in the body, he may be allowed to say,
but not till then, 'Really, I almost think I am not quite
well.'"</p>
<p>The moral authority he had acquired over me was so great that in
no case would I have disobeyed him, even had he ordered me to jump
out of window.</p>
<p>I recollect that when my first tooth was drawn, I was in an
agony of fright as we went to the dentist; but outwardly I was
brave enough, and tried to seem as indifferent as possible. On
another occasion my childish courage and also my father's firmness
were put to a more serious test. He had hired a house called the
Villa Billi, which stands about half a mile from San Domenico di
Fiesole, on the right winding up toward the hill. Only two years
ago I visited the place, and found the same family of peasants
still there, and my two old playmates, Nando and Sandro,--who had
both become even greater fogies than myself,--and we had a hearty
chat together about bygone times.</p>
<p>Whilst living at this villa, our father was accustomed to take
us out for long walks, which were the subject of special
regulations. We were strictly forbidden to ask, "Have we far to
go?"--"What time is it?" or to say, "I am thirsty; I am hungry; I
am tired:" but in everything else we had full liberty of speech and
action. Returning from one of these excursions, we one day found
ourselves below Castel di Poggio, a rugged stony path leading
towards Vincigliata. In one hand I had a nosegay of wild flowers,
gathered by the way, and in the other a stick, when I happened to
stumble, and fell awkwardly. My father sprang forward to pick me
up, and seeing that one arm pained me, he examined it and found
that in fact the bone was broken below the elbow. All this time my
eyes were fixed upon him, and I could see his countenance change,
and assume such an expression of tenderness and anxiety that he no
longer appeared to be the same man. He bound up my arm as well as
he could, and we then continued our way homewards. After a few
moments, during which my father had resumed his usual calmness, he
said to me:--</p>
<p>"Listen, Mammolino: your mother is not well. If she knows you
are hurt it will make her worse. You must be brave, my boy:
to-morrow morning we will go to Florence, where all that is needful
can be done for you; but this evening you must not show you are in
pain. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>All this was said with his usual firmness and authority, but
also with the greatest affection. I was only too glad to have so
important and difficult a task intrusted to me. The whole evening I
sat quietly in a corner, supporting my poor little broken arm as
best I could, and my mother only thought me tired by the long walk,
and had no suspicion of the truth.</p>
<p>The next day I was taken to Florence, and my arm was set; but to
complete the cure I had to be sent to the Baths of Vinadio a few
years afterward. Some people may, in this instance, think my father
was cruel. I remember the fact as if it were but yesterday, and I
am sure such an idea never for one minute entered my mind. The
expression of ineffable tenderness which I had read in his eyes had
so delighted me, it seemed so reasonable to avoid alarming my
mother, that I looked on the hard task allotted me as a fine
opportunity of displaying my courage. I did so because I had not
been spoilt, and good principles had been early implanted within
me: and now that I am an old man and have known the world, I bless
the severity of my father; and I could wish every Italian child
might have one like him, and derive more profit than I did,--in
thirty years' time Italy would then be the first of nations.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is a fact that children are much more observant
than is commonly supposed, and never regard as hostile a just but
affectionate severity. I have always seen them disposed to prefer
persons who keep them in order to those who constantly yield to
their caprices; and soldiers are just the same in this respect.</p>
<p>The following is another example to prove that my father did not
deserve to be called cruel:--</p>
<p>He thought it a bad practice to awaken children suddenly, or to
let their sleep be abruptly disturbed. If we had to rise early for
a journey, he would come to my bedside and softly hum a popular
song, two lines of which still ring in my ears:--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i5">"Chi vuol veder l'aurora</p>
<p class="i5">Lasci le molli plume."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i3">(He who the early dawn would view</p>
<p class="i3">Downy pillows must eschew.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And by gradually raising his voice, he awoke me without the
slightest start. In truth, with all his severity, Heaven knows how
I loved him.</p>

<h3>THE PRIESTHOOD</h3>
<center>From 'My Recollections'</center>
<p>My occupations in Rome were not entirely confined to the domains
of poetry and imagination. It must not be forgotten that I was also
a diplomatist; and in that capacity I had social as well as
official duties to perform.</p>
<p>The Holy Alliance had accepted the confession and repentance of
Murat, and had granted him absolution; but as the new convert
inspired little confidence, he was closely watched, in the
expectation--and perhaps the hope--of an opportunity of crowning
the work by the infliction of penance.</p>
<p>The penance intended was to deprive him of his crown and
sceptre, and to turn him out of the pale. Like all the other
diplomatists resident in Rome, we kept our court well informed of
all that could be known or surmised regarding the intentions of the
Neapolitan government; and I had the lively occupation of copying
page after page of incomprehensible cipher for the newborn archives
of our legation. Such was my life at that time; and in spite of the
cipher, I soon found it pleasant enough. Dinner-parties, balls,
routs, and fashionable society did not then inspire me with the
holy horror which now keeps me away from them. Having never before
experienced or enjoyed anything of the kind, I was satisfied. But
in the midst of my pleasure, our successor--Marquis San
Saturnino--made his appearance, and we had to prepare for our
departure. One consolation, however, remained. I had just then been
appointed to the high rank of cornet in the crack dragoon regiment
"Royal Piedmont." I had never seen its uniform, but I cherished a
vague hope of being destined by Fortune to wear a helmet; and the
prospect of realizing this splendid dream of my infancy prevented
me from regretting my Roman acquaintances overmuch.</p>
<p>The Society of Jesus had meanwhile been restored, and my brother
was on the eve of taking the vows. He availed himself of the last
days left him before that ceremony to sit for his portrait to the
painter Landi. This is one of that artist's best works, who, poor
man, cannot boast of many; and it now belongs to my nephew
Emanuel.</p>
<p>The day of the ceremony at length arrived, and I accompanied my
brother to the Convent of Monte Cavallo, where it was to take
place.</p>
<p>The Jesuits at that time were all greatly rejoicing at the
revival of their order; and as may be inferred, they were mostly
old men, with only a few young novices among them.</p>
<p>We entered an oratory fragrant with the flowers adorning the
altar, full of silver ornaments, holy images, and burning
wax-lights, with half-closed windows and carefully drawn blinds;
for it is a certain, although unexplained, fact that men are more
devout in the dark than in the light, at night than in the
day-time, and with their eyes closed rather than open. We were
received by the General of the order, Father Panizzoni, a little
old man bent double with age, his eyes encircled with red, half
blind, and I believe almost in his dotage. He was shedding tears of
joy, and we all maintained the pious and serious aspect suited to
the occasion, until the time arrived for the novice to step
forward, when, lo! Father Panizzoni advanced with open arms toward
the place where I stood, mistaking me for my brother; a blunder
which for a moment imperiled the solemnity of the assembly.</p>
<p>Had I yielded to the embrace of Father Panizzoni, it would have
been a wonderful bargain both for him and me. But this was not the
only invitation I then received to enter upon a sacerdotal career.
Monsignor Morozzo, my great-uncle and god-father, then secretary to
the bishops and regular monks, one day proposed that I should enter
the Ecclesiastical Academy, and follow the career of the prelacy
under his patronage. The idea seemed so absurd that I could not
help laughing heartily, and the subject was never revived.</p>
<p>Had I accepted these overtures, I might in the lapse of time
have long since been a cardinal, and perhaps even Pope. And if so,
I should have drawn the world after me, as the shepherd entices a
lamb with a lump of salt. It was very wrong in me to refuse.
Doubtless the habit of expressing my opinion to every one, and on
all occasions, would have led me into many difficulties. I must
either have greatly changed, or a very few years would have seen an
end of me.</p>
<p>We left Rome at last, in the middle of winter, in an open
carriage, and traveling chiefly by night, as was my father's habit.
While the horses are trotting on, I will sum up the impressions of
Rome and the Roman world which I was carrying away. The clearest
idea present to my mind was that the priests of Rome and their
religion had very little in common with my father and Don Andreis,
or with the religion professed by them and by the priests and the
devout laity of Turin. I had not been able to detect the slightest
trace of that which in the language of asceticism is called
unction. I know not why, but that grave and downcast aspect,
enlivened only by a few occasional flashes of ponderous clerical
wit, the atmosphere depressing as the <i>plumbeus auster</i> of
Horace, in which I had been brought up under the rule of my
priest,--all seemed unknown at Rome. There I never met with a
monsignore or a priest who did not step out with a pert and jaunty
air, his head erect, showing off a well-made leg, and daintily
attired in the garb of a clerical dandy. Their conversation turned
upon every possible subject, and sometimes upon <i>quibusdam
aliis</i>, to such a degree that it was evident my father was
perpetually on thorns. I remember a certain prelate, whom I will
not name, and whose conduct was, I believe, sufficiently free and
easy, who at a dinner-party at a villa near Porta Pia related
laughingly some matrimonial anecdotes, which I at that time did not
fully understand. And I remember also my poor father's manifest
distress, and his strenuous endeavors to change the conversation
and direct it into a different channel.</p>
<p>The prelates and priests whom I used to meet in less orthodox
companies than those frequented by my father seemed to me still
more free and easy. Either in the present or in the past, in theory
or in practice, with more or less or even no concealment, they all
alike were sailing or had sailed on the sweet <i>fleuve du
tendre</i>. For instance, I met one old canon bound to a venerable
dame by a tie of many years' standing. I also met a young prelate
with a pink-and-white complexion and eyes expressive of anything
but holiness; he was a desperate votary of the fair sex, and
swaggered about paying his homage right and left. Will it be
believed, this gay apostle actually told me, without
circumlocution, that in the monastery of Tor di Specchi there dwelt
a young lady who was in love with me? I, who of course desired no
better, took the hint instantly, and had her pointed out to me.
Then began an interchange of silly messages, of languishing looks,
and a hundred absurdities of the same kind; all cut short by the
pair of post-horses which carried us out of the Porta del
Popolo....</p>
<p>The opinions of my father respecting the clergy and the Court of
Rome were certainly narrow and prejudiced; but with his good sense
it was impossible for him not to perceive what was manifest even to
a blind man. During our journey he kept insinuating (without
appearing, however, to attach much importance to it) that it was
always advisable to speak with proper respect of a country where we
had been well received, even if we had noticed a great many abuses
and disorders. To a certain extent, this counsel was well worthy of
attention. He was doubtless much grieved at the want of decency
apparent in one section of that society, or, to use a modern
expression, at its absence of respectability; but he consoled
himself by thinking, like Abraham the Jew in the 'Decameron,' that
no better proof can be given of the truth of the religion professed
by Rome than the fact of its enduring in such hands.</p>
<p>This reasoning, however, is not quite conclusive; for if
Boccaccio had had patience to wait another forty years, he would
have learnt, first from John Huss, and then from Luther and his
followers, that although in certain hands things may last a while,
it is only till they are worn out. What Boccaccio and the Jew would
say now if they came back, I do not venture to surmise,</p>
<br>
<a name="AZEGLIO_3"></a>
<h3>MY FIRST VENTURE IN ROMANCE</h3>
<center>From 'My Recollections'</center>
<p>While striving to acquire a good artistic position in my new
residence, I had still continued to work at my 'Fieramosca,' which
was now almost completed. Letters were at that time represented at
Milan by Manzoni, Grossi, Torti, Pompeo Litta, etc. The memories of
the period of Monti, Parini, Foscolo, Porta, Pellico, Verri,
Beccaria, were still fresh; and however much the living literary
and scientific men might be inclined to lead a secluded life,
intrenched in their own houses, with the shyness of people who
disliked much intercourse with the world, yet by a little tact
those who wished for their company could overcome their reserve. As
Manzoni's son-in-law, I found myself naturally brought into contact
with them. I knew them all; but Grossi and I became particularly
intimate, and our close and uninterrupted friendship lasted until
the day of his but too premature death. I longed to show my work to
him, and especially to Manzoni, and ask their advice; but fear this
time, not artistic but literary, had again caught hold of me.
Still, a resolve was necessary, and was taken at last. I disclosed
my secret, imploring forbearance and advice, but no
<i>indulgence</i>. I wanted the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth. I preferred the blame of a couple of trusted friends
to that of the public. Both seemed to have expected something a
great deal worse than what they heard, to judge by their startled
but also approving countenances, when my novel was read to them.
Manzoni remarked with a smile, "We literary men have a strange
profession indeed--any one can take it up in a day. Here is
Massimo: the whim of writing a novel seizes him, and upon my word
he does not do badly, after all!"</p>
<p>This high approbation inspired me with leonine courage, and I
set to work again in earnest, so that in 1833 the work was ready
for publication. On thinking it over now, it strikes me that I was
guilty of great impertinence in thus bringing out and publishing
with undaunted assurance my little novel among all those literary
big-wigs; I who had never done or written anything before. But it
was successful; and this is an answer to every objection.</p>
<p>The day I carried my bundle of manuscript to San Pietro all'
Orto, and, as Berni expresses it,--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">"--ritrovato</p>
<p class="i1">Un che di stampar opere lavora,</p>
<p class="i1">Dissi, Stampami questa alla malora!"</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i9">(--having</p>
<p>Discovered one, a publisher by trade,</p>
<p>'Print me this book, bad luck to it!' I said.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I was in a still greater funk than on the two previous
occasions. But I had yet to experience the worst I ever felt in the
whole course of my life, and that was on the day of publication;
when I went out in the morning, and read my illustrious name
placarded in large letters on the street walls! I felt blinded by a
thousand sparks. Now indeed <i>alea jacta erat</i>, and my fleet
was burnt to ashes.</p>
<p>This great fear of the public may, with good-will, be taken for
modesty; but I hold that at bottom it is downright vanity. Of
course I am speaking of people endowed with a sufficient dose of
talent and common-sense; with fools, on the contrary, vanity takes
the shape of impudent self-confidence. Hence all the daily
published amount of nonsense; which would convey a strange idea of
us to Europe, if it were not our good fortune that Italian is not
much understood abroad. As regards our internal affairs, the two
excesses are almost equally noxious. In Parliament, for instance,
the first, those of the timidly vain genus, might give their
opinion a little oftener with general advantage; while if the
others, the impudently vain, were not always brawling, discussions
would be more brief and rational, and public business better and
more quickly dispatched. The same reflection applies to other
branches--to journalism, literature, society, etc.; for vanity is
the bad weed which chokes up our political field; and as it is a
plant of hardy growth, blooming among us all the year round, it is
just as well to be on our guard.</p>
<p>Timid vanity was terribly at work within me the day 'Fieramosca'
was published. For the first twenty-four hours it was impossible to
learn anything; for even the most zealous require at least a day to
form some idea of a book. Next morning, on first going out, I
encountered a friend of mine, a young fellow then and now a man of
mature age, who has never had a suspicion of the cruel blow he
unconsciously dealt me. I met him in Piazza San Fedele, where I
lived; and after a few words, he said, "By the by, I hear you have
published a novel. Well done!" and then talked away about something
quite different with the utmost heedlessness. Not a drop of blood
was left in my veins, and I said to myself, "Mercy on me! I am done
for: not even a word is said about my poor 'Fieramosca!'" It seemed
incredible that he, who belonged to a very numerous family,
connected with the best society of the town, should have heard
nothing, if the slightest notice had been taken of it. As he was
besides an excellent fellow and a friend, it seemed equally
incredible that if a word had been said and heard, he should not
have repeated it to me. Therefore, it was a failure; the worst of
failures, that of silence. With a bitter feeling at heart, I hardly
knew where I went; but this feeling soon changed, and the
bitterness was superseded by quite an opposite sensation.</p>
<p>'Fieramosca' succeeded, and succeeded so well that I felt
<i>abasourdi</i>, as the French express it; indeed, I could say "Je
n'aurais jamais cru &ecirc;tre si fort savant." My success went on
in an increasing ratio: it passed from the papers and from the
masculine half to the feminine half of society; it found its way to
the studios and the stage. I became the vade-mecum of every
prima-donna and tenor, the hidden treat of school-girls; I
penetrated between the pillow and the mattress of college, boys, of
the military academy cadet; and my apotheosis reached such a height
that some newspapers asserted it to be Manzoni's work. It is
superfluous to add that only the ignorant could entertain such an
idea; those who were better informed would never have made such a
blunder.</p>
<p>My aim, as I said, was to take the initiative in the slow work
of the regeneration of national character. I had no wish but to
awaken high and noble sentiments in Italian hearts; and if all the
literary men in the world had assembled to condemn me in virtue of
strict rules, I should not have cared a jot, if, in defiance of all
existing rules, I succeeded in inflaming the heart of one single
individual. And I will also add, who can say that what causes
durable emotion is unorthodox? It may be at variance with some
rules and in harmony with others; and those which move hearts and
captivate intellects do not appear to me to be the worst.</p>

<p>he emperor Baber was sixth in descent from Tamerlane, who died
in 1405. Tamerlane's conquests were world-wide, but they never
formed a homogeneous empire. Even in his lifetime he parceled them
out to sons and grandsons. Half a century later Trans-oxiana was
divided into many independent kingdoms each governed by a
descendant of the great conqueror.</p>
<p>When Baber was born (1482), an uncle was King of Samarkand and
Bokhara; another uncle ruled Badakhshan; another was King of Kabul.
A relative was the powerful King of Khorasan. These princes were of
the family of Tamerlane, as was Baber's father,--Sultan Omer Sheikh
Mirza, who was the King of Ferghana. Two of Baber's maternal
uncles, descendants of Chengiz Khan, ruled the Moghul tribes to the
west and north of Ferghana; and two of their sisters had married
the Kings of Samarkand and Badakhshan. The third sister was Baber's
mother, wife of the King of Ferghana.</p>
<p>The capitals of their countries were cities like Samarkand,
Bokhara, and Herat. Tamerlane's grandson--Ulugh Beg--built at
Samarkand the chief astronomical observatory of the world, a
century and a half before Tycho Brahe (1576) erected Uranibourg in
Denmark. The town was filled with noble buildings,--mosques, tombs,
and colleges. Its walls were five miles in circumference<a name=
"FNanchor2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2">[2]</a>.</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor2">[2]</a>
Paris was walled in 1358; so Froissart tells us.</blockquote>
<p>Its streets were paved (the streets of Paris were not paved till
the time of Henri IV.), and running water was distributed in pipes.
Its markets overflowed with fruits. Its cooks and bakers were noted
for their skill. Its colleges were full of learned men,
poets<a name="FNanchor3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3">[3]</a>, and
doctors of the law. The observatory counted more than a hundred
observers and calculators in its corps of astronomers. The products
of China, of India, and of Persia flowed to the bazaars.</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor3">[3]</a>
"In Samarkand, the Odes of Baiesanghar Mirza are so popular, that
there is not a house in which a copy of them may not be
found."--Baber's. 'Memoirs.'</blockquote>
<p>Bokhara has always been the home of learning. Herat was at that
time the most magnificent and refined city of the world<a name=
"FNanchor4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4">[4]</a>. The court was
splendid, polite, intelligent, and liberal. Poetry, history,
philosophy, science, and the arts of painting and music were
cultivated by noblemen and scholars alike. Baber himself was a poet
of no mean rank. The religion was that of Islam, and the sect the
orthodox Sunni; but the practice was less precise than in Arabia.
Wine was drunk; poetry was prized; artists were encouraged. The
mother-language of Baber was Turki (of which the Turkish of
Constantinople is a dialect). Arabic was the language of science
and of theology. Persian was the accepted literary language, though
Baber's verses are in Turki as well.</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor4">[4]</a>
Baber spent twenty days in visiting its various palaces, towers,
mosques, gardens, colleges--and gives a list of more than fifty
such sights.</blockquote>
<p>We possess Baber's 'Memoirs' in the original Turki and in
Persian translations also. In what follows, the extracts will be

of his conquests can be found in 'The Mogul Emperors of
Hindustan<a name="FNanchor6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6">[6]</a>.' We

<h3>FROM BABER'S 'MEMOIRS'</h3>
<p>In the month, of Ramzan, in the year 899 [A. D. 1494], and in
the twelfth year of my age, I became King of Ferghana.</p>
<p>The country of Ferghana is situated in the fifth climate, on the
extreme boundary of the habitable world. On the east it has
Kashgar; on the west, Samarkand; on the south, the hill country; on
the north, in former times there were cities, yet at the present
time, in consequence of the incursions of the Usbeks, no population
remains. Ferghana is a country of small extent, abounding in grain
and fruits. The revenues may suffice, without oppressing the
country, to maintain three or four thousand troops.</p>
<p>My father, Omer Sheikh Mirza, was of low stature, had a short,
bushy beard, brownish hair, and was very corpulent. As for his
opinions and habits, he was of the sect of Hanifah, and strict in
his belief. He never neglected the five regular and stated prayers.
He read elegantly, and he was particularly fond of reading the
'Shahnameh<a name="FNanchor7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7">[7]</a>.'
Though he had a turn for poetry, he did not cultivate it. He was so
strictly just, that when the caravan from [China] had once reached
the hill country to the east of Ardejan, and the snow fell so deep
as to bury it, so that of the whole only two persons escaped; he no
sooner received information of the occurrence than he dispatched
overseers to take charge of all the property, and he placed it
under guard and preserved it untouched, till in the course of one
or two years, the heirs coming from Khorasan, he delivered back the
goods safe into their hands. His generosity was large, and so was
his whole soul; he was of an excellent temper, affable, eloquent,
and sweet in his conversation, yet brave withal and manly.</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor7">[7]</a>
The 'Book of Kings,' by the Persian poet Firdausi.</blockquote>
<p>The early portion of Baber's 'Memoirs' is given to portraits of
the officers of his court and country. A few of these may be
quoted.</p>
<p>Khosrou Shah, though a Turk, applied his attention to the mode
of raising his revenues, and he spent them liberally. At the death
of Sultan Mahmud Mirza, he reached the highest pitch of greatness,
and his retainers rose to the number of twenty thousand. Though he
prayed regularly and abstained from forbidden foods, yet he was
black-hearted and vicious, of mean understanding and slender
talents, faithless and a traitor. For the sake of the short and
fleeting pomp of this vain world, he put out the eyes of one and
murdered another of the sons of the benefactor in whose service he
had been, and by whom he had been protected; rendering himself
accursed of God, abhorred of men, and worthy of execration and
shame till the day of final retribution. These crimes he
perpetrated merely to secure the enjoyment of some poor worldly
vanities; yet with all the power of his many and populous
territories, in spite of his magazines of warlike stores, he had
not the spirit to face a barnyard chicken. He will often be
mentioned in these memoirs.</p>
<p>Ali Shir Beg was celebrated for the elegance of his manners; and
this elegance and polish were ascribed to the conscious pride of
high fortune: but this was not the case; they were natural to him.
Indeed, Ali Shir Beg was an incomparable person. From the time that
poetry was first written in the Turki language, no man has written
so much and so well. He has also left excellent pieces of music;
they are excellent both as to the airs themselves and as to the
preludes. There is not upon record in history any man who was a
greater patron and protector of men of talent than he. He had no
son nor daughter, nor wife nor family; he passed through the world
single and unincumbered.</p>
<p>Another poet was Sheikhem Beg. He composed a sort of verses, in
which both the words and the sense are terrifying and correspond
with each other. The following is one of his couplets:--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>During my sorrows of the night, the whirlpool of my sighs
bears</i></p>
<p class="i9"><i>the firmament from its place</i>;</p>
<p><i>The dragons of the inundations of my tears bear down the
four</i></p>
<p class="i9"><i>quarters of the habitable world</i>!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is well known that on one occasion, having repeated these
verses to Moulana Abdal Rahman Jami, the Mulla said, "Are you
repeating poetry, or are you terrifying folks?"</p>
<p>A good many men who wrote verses happened to be present. During
the party the following verse of Muhammed Salikh was
repeated:--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>What can one do to regulate his thoughts, with a mistress
possessed</i></p>
<p class="i9"><i>of every blandishment</i>?</p>
<p><i>Where you are, how is it possible for our thoughts to wander
to</i></p>
<p class="i9"><i>another</i>?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It was agreed that every one should make an extempore couplet to
the same rhyme and measure. Every one accordingly repeated his
verse. As we had been very merry, I repeated the following
extempore satirical verses:--</p>
<blockquote><i>What can one do with a drunken sot like you?<br>
What can be done with one foolish as a she-ass?</i></blockquote>
<p>Before this, whatever had come into my head, good or bad, I had
always committed it to writing. On the present occasion, when I had
composed these lines, my mind led me to reflections, and my heart
was struck with regret that a tongue which could repeat the
sublimest productions should bestow any trouble on such unworthy
verses; that it was melancholy that a heart elevated to nobler
conceptions should submit to occupy itself with these meaner and
despicable fancies. From that time forward I religiously abstained
from satirical poetry. I had not then formed my resolution, nor
considered how objectionable the practice was.</p>
<br>
<center>TRANSACTIONS OF THE YEAR 904 [A.D. 1498-99]</center>
<br>
<p>Having failed in repeated expeditions against Samarkand and
Ardejan, I once more returned to Khojend. Khojend is but a small
place; and it is difficult for one to support two hundred retainers
in it. How then could a [young] man, ambitious of empire, set
himself down contentedly in so insignificant a place? As soon as I
received advice that the garrison of Ardejan had declared for me, I
made no delay. And thus, by the grace of the Most High, I recovered
my paternal kingdom, of which I had been deprived nearly two years.
An order was issued that such as had accompanied me in my campaigns
might resume possession of whatever part of their property they
recognized. Although the order seemed reasonable and just in
itself, yet it was issued with too much precipitation. It was a
senseless thing to exasperate so many men with arms in their hands.
In war and in affairs of state, though things may appear just and
reasonable at first sight, no matter ought to be finally decided
without being well weighed and considered in a hundred different
lights. From my issuing this single order without sufficient
foresight, what commotions and mutinies arose! This inconsiderate
order of mine was in reality the ultimate cause of my being a
second time expelled from Ardejan.</p>
<p>Baber's next campaign was most arduous, but in passing by a
spring he had the leisure to have these verses of Saadi inscribed
on its brink:--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2"><i>I have heard that the exalted Jemshid</i></p>
<p class="i2"><i>Inscribed on a stone beside a fountain</i>:--</p>
<p>"<i>Many a man like us has rested by this fountain</i>,</p>
<p><i>And disappeared in the twinkling of an eye</i>.</p>
<p><i>Should we conquer the whole world by our manhood and
strength</i>,</p>
<p><i>Yet could we not carry it with us to the grave."</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Of another fountain he says:--"I directed this fountain to be
built round with stone, and formed a cistern. At the time when the
<i>Arghwan</i> flowers begin to blow, I do not know that any place
in the world is to be compared to it." On its sides he engraved
these verses:--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2"><i>Sweet is the return of the new year</i>;</p>
<p class="i3"><i>Sweet is the smiling spring</i>;</p>
<p class="i2"><i>Sweet is the juice of the mellow grape</i>;</p>
<p class="i3"><i>Sweeter far the voice of love</i>.</p>
<p><i>Strive, O Baber! to secure the joys of life</i>,</p>
<p><i>Which, alas! once departed, never more return.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>From these flowers Baber and his army marched into the passes of
the high mountains.</p>
<p>His narrative goes on:--</p>
<p>It was at this time that I composed the following verses:--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>There is no violence or injury of fortune that I have not
experienced</i>;</p>
<p><i>This broken heart has endured them all. Alas! is there one
left</i></p>
<p><i>that I have not encountered</i>?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For about a week we continued pressing down the snow without
being able to advance more than two or three miles. I myself
assisted in trampling down the snow. Every step we sank up to the
middle or the breast, but we still went on, trampling it down. As
the strength of the person who went first was generally exhausted
after he had advanced a few paces, he stood still, while another
took his place. The ten, fifteen, or twenty people who worked in
trampling down the snow, next succeeded in dragging on a horse
without a rider. Drawing this horse aside, we brought on another,
and in this way ten, fifteen, or twenty of us contrived to bring
forward the horses of all our number. The rest of the troops, even
our best men, advanced along the road that had been beaten for
them, hanging their heads. This was no time for plaguing them or
employing authority. Every man who possesses spirit or emulation
hastens to such works of himself. Continuing to advance by a track
which we beat in the snow in this manner, we reached a cave at the
foot of the Zirrin pass. That day the storm of wind was dreadful.
The snow fell in such quantities that we all expected to meet death
together. The cave seemed to be small. I took a hoe and made for
myself at the mouth of the cave a resting-place about the size of a
prayer-carpet. I dug down in the snow as deep as my breast, and yet
did not reach the ground. This hole afforded me some shelter from
the wind, and I sat down in it. Some desired me to go into the
cavern, but I would not go. I felt that for me to be in a warm
dwelling, while my men were in the, midst of snow and drift,--for
me to be within, enjoying sleep and ease, while my followers were
in trouble and distress,--would be inconsistent with what I owed
them, and a deviation from that society in suffering which was
their due. I continued, therefore, to sit in the drift.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6"><i>Ambition admits not of inaction</i>;</p>
<p class="i6"><i>The world is his who exerts himself</i>;</p>
<p class="i6"><i>In wisdom's eye, every condition</i></p>
<p class="i6"><i>May find repose save royalty alone.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>By leadership like this, the descendant of Tamerlane became the
ruler of Kabul. He celebrates its charms in verse:--</p>
<blockquote><i>Its verdure and flowers render Kabul, in spring, a
heaven.</i>--</blockquote>
<p>but this kingdom was too small for a man of Baber's stamp. He
used it as a stepping-stone to the conquest of India (1526).</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Return a hundred thanks, O Baber! for the bounty of the
merciful God</i></p>
<p class="i2"><i>Has given you Sind, Hind, and numerous
kingdoms</i>;</p>
<p class="i2"><i>If, unable to stand the heat, you long for
cold</i>,</p>
<p class="i2"><i>You have only to recollect the frost and cold of
Ghazni.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In spite of these verses, Baber did not love India, and his
monarchy was an exile to him. Let the last extract from his memoirs
be a part of a letter written in 1529 to an old and trusted friend
in Kabul. It is an outpouring of the griefs of his inmost heart to
his friend. He says:--</p>
<p>My solicitude to visit my western dominions (Kabul) is boundless
and great beyond expression. I trust in Almighty Allah that the
time is near at hand when everything will be completely settled in
this country. As soon as matters are brought to that state, I
shall, with the permission of Allah, set out for your quarters
without a moment's delay. How is it possible that the delights of
those lands should ever be erased from the heart? How is it
possible to forget the delicious melons and grapes of that pleasant
region? They very recently brought me a single muskmelon from
Kabul. While cutting it up, I felt myself affected with a strong
feeling of loneliness and a sense of my exile from my native
country, and I could not help shedding tears. [He gives long
instructions on the military and political matters to be attended
to, and continues without a break:--] At the southwest of Besteh I
formed a plantation of trees; and as the prospect from it was very
fine, I called it Nazergah [the view]. You must there plant some
beautiful trees, and all around sow beautiful and sweet-smelling
flowers and shrubs. [And he goes straight on:--] Syed Kasim will
accompany the artillery. [After more details of the government he
quotes fondly a little trivial incident of former days and friends,
and says:--] Do not think amiss of me for deviating into these
fooleries. I conclude with every good wish. /#</p>
<p>The 'Memoirs' of Baber deserve a place beside the writings of
the greatest of generals and conquerors. He is not unworthy to be
classed with Caesar as a general and as a man of letters. His
character was more human, more frank, more lovable, more ardent.
His fellow in our western world is not Caesar, but Henri IV. of
France and Navarre.</p>

<p>abrius, also referred to as Babrias and Gabrias, was the writer
of that metrical version of the folk-fables, commonly referred to
Aesop, which delights our childhood. Until the time of Richard
Bentley he was commonly thought of merely as a fabulist whose
remains had been preserved by a few grammarians. Bentley, in the
first draft (1697) of the part of his famous 'Dissertation'
treating of the fables of Aesop, speaks thus of Babrius, and goes
not far out of his way to give a rap at Planudes, a late Greek, who
turned works of Ovid, Cato, and Caesar into Greek:--</p>
<blockquote>"... came one Babrius, that gave a new turn of the
fables into choliambics. Nobody that I know of mentions him but
Suidas, Avienus, and Tzetzes. There's one Gabrias, indeed, yet
extant, that has comprised each fable in four sorry iambics. But
our Babrius is a writer of another size and quality; and were his
book now extant, it might justly be opposed, if not preferred, to
the Latin of Phaedrus. There's a whole fable of his yet preserved
at the end of Gabrias, of 'The Swallow and the Nightingale.' Suidas
brings many citations out of him, all which show him an excellent
poet.... There are two parcels of the present fables; the one,
which are the more ancient, one hundred and thirty-six in number,
were first published out of the Heidelberg Library by Neveletus,
1610. The editor himself well observed that they were falsely
ascribed to Aesop, because they mention holy monks. To which I will
add another remark,--that there is a sentence out of Job.... Thus I
have proved one-half of the fables now extant that carry the name
of Aesop to be above a thousand years more recent than he. And the
other half, that were public before Neveletus, will be found yet
more modern, and the latest of all.... This collection, therefore,
is more recent than that other; and, coming first abroad with
Aesop's 'Life,' written by Planudes, 'tis justly believed to be
owing to the same writer. That idiot of a monk has given us a book
which he calls 'The Life of Aesop,' that perhaps cannot be matched
in any language for ignorance and nonsense. He had picked up two or
three true stories,--that Aesop was a slave to a Xanthus, carried a
burthen of bread, conversed with Croesus, and was put to death at
Delphi; but the circumstances of these and all his other tales are
pure invention.... But of all his injuries to Aesop, that which can
least be forgiven him is the making such a monster of him for
ugliness,--an abuse that has found credit so universally that all
the modern painters since the time of Planudes have drawn him in
the worst shapes and features that fancy could invent. 'Twas an old
tradition among the Greeks that Aesop revived again and lived a
second life. Should he revive once more and see the picture before
the book that carries his name, could he think it drawn for
himself?--or for the monkey, or some strange beast introduced in
the 'Fables'? But what revelation had this monk about Aesop's
deformity? For he must have it by dream or vision, and not by
ordinary methods of knowledge. He lived about two thousand years
after him, and in all that tract of time there's not a single
author that has given the least hint that Aesop was
ugly."</blockquote>
<p>Thus Bentley; but to return to Babrius. Tyrwhitt, in 1776,
followed this calculation of Bentley by collecting the remains of
Babrius. A publication in 1809 of fables from a Florentine
manuscript foreran the collection (1832) of all the fables which
could be entirely restored. In 1835 a German scholar, Knoch,
published whatever had up to that time been written on Babrius, or
as far as then known by him. So much had been accomplished by
modern scholarship. The calculation was not unlike the mathematical
computation that a star should, from an apparent disturbance, be in
a certain quarter of the heavens at a certain time. The manuscript
of Babrius, it became clear, must have existed. In 1842 M. Mynas, a
Greek, who had already discovered the 'Philosophoumena' of
Hippolytus, came upon the parchment in the convent of St. Lama on
Mount Athos. He was employed by the French government, and the duty
of giving the new ancient to the world fell to French scholars. The
date of the manuscript they referred to the tenth century. There
were contained in it one hundred and twenty-three of the supposed
one hundred and sixty fables, the arrangement being alphabetical
and ending with the letter O. Again, in 1857 M. Mynas announced
another discovery. Ninety-four fables and a prooemium were still in
a convent at Mount Athos; but the monks, who made difficulty about
parting with the first parchment, refused to let the second go
abroad. M. Mynas forwarded a transcript which he sold to the
British Museum. It was after examination pronounced to be the work
of a forger, and not even what it purported to be--the tinkering of
a writer who had turned the original of Babrius into barbarous
Greek and halting metre. Suggestions were made that the forger was
Mynas himself. And there were scholars who accounted the manuscript
as genuine.</p>
<p>The discovery of the first part added substantially to the
remains which we have of the poetry of ancient Greece. The
terseness, simplicity, and humor of the poems belong to the popular
classic all the world over, in whatever tongue it appears; and the
purity of the Greek shows that Babrius lived at a time when the
influence of the classical age was still vital. He is placed at
various times. Bergk fixes him so far back as B.C. 250, while
others place him at the same number of years in our own era. Both
French and German criticism has claimed that he was a Roman. There
is no trace of his fables earlier than the Emperor Julian, and no
metrical version of the Aesopean fables existed before the writing
of Babrius. Socrates tried his hand at a version or two. But when
such Greek writers as Xenophon and Aristotle refer to old
folk-tales and legends, it is always in their own words. His fables
are written in choliambic verse; that is, imperfect iambic which
has a spondee in the last foot and is fitted for the satire for
which it was originally used.</p>
<p>The fables of Babrius have been edited, with an interesting and
valuable introduction, by W.G. Rutherford (1883), and by F.G.
Schneidewin (1880). They have been turned into English metre by
James Davies, M.A. (1860). The reader is also referred to the
article 'Aesop' in the present work.</p>

<h2>FRANCIS <a name="BACON"></a>BACON</h2>
<h3>(1561-1626)</h3>
<h3>BY CHARLTON T. LEWIS</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>he startling contrasts of splendor and humiliation which marked
the life of Bacon, and the seemingly incredible inconsistencies
which hasty observers find in his character, have been the themes
of much rhetorical declamation, and even of serious and learned
debate. From Ben Jonson in his own day, to James Spedding the
friend of Tennyson, he has not lacked eminent eulogists, who look
up to him as not only the greatest and wisest, but as among the
noblest and most worthy of mankind: while the famous epigram of
Pope, expanded by Macaulay into a stately and eloquent essay, has
impressed on the popular mind the lowest estimate of his moral
nature; and even such careful scholars as Charles de R&eacute;musat
and Dean Church, who have devoted careful and instructive volumes
to the survey of Bacon's career and works, insist that with all his
intellectual supremacy, he was a servile courtier, a false friend,
and a corrupt judge. Yet there are few important names in human
history of men who have left us so complete materials for a just
judgment of their conduct; and it is only a lover of paradox who
can read these and still regard Bacon's character as an unsolved
problem.</p>
<p>Mr. Spedding has given a long life of intelligent labor to the
collection of every fact and document throwing light upon the
motives, aims, and thoughts of the great "Chancellor of Nature,"
from the cradle to the grave. The results are before us in the
seven volumes of 'The Letters and the Life of Francis Bacon,' which
form perhaps the most complete biography ever written. It is a book
of absolute candor as well as infinite research, giving with equal
distinctness all the evidence which makes for its hero's dishonor
and that which tends to justify the writer's reverence for him.
Another work by Mr. Spedding, 'Evenings with a Reviewer,' in two
volumes, is an elaborate refutation, from the original and
authentic records, of the most damning charges brought by Lord
Macaulay against Bacon's good fame. It is a complete and
overwhelming exposure of false coloring, of rhetorical artifices,
and of the abuse of evidence, in the famous essay. As one of the
most entertaining and instructive pieces of controversy in our
literature, it deserves to be widely read. The unbiased reader
cannot accept the special pleading by which, in his comments,
Spedding makes every failing of Bacon "lean to virtue's side"; but
will form upon the unquestioned facts presented a clear conception
of him, will come to know him as no other man of an age so remote
is known, and will find in his many-sided and magnificent nature a
full explanation of the impressions which partial views of it have
made upon his worshipers and his detractors.</p>
<p>It is only in his maturity, indeed, that we are privileged to
enter into his mind and read his heart. But enough is known of the
formative period of his life to show us the sources of his
weaknesses and of his strength. The child whom high authorities
have regarded as endowed with the mightiest intellect of the human
race was born at York House, on the Strand, in the third year of
Elizabeth's reign, January 22d, 1561. He was the son of the Queen's
Lord Keeper of the Seals, Sir Nicholas Bacon, and his second wife
Anne, daughter of Sir Anthony Cook, formerly tutor of King Edward
VI. Mildred, an elder daughter of the same scholar, was the wife of
William Cecil, Lord Burghley, who for the first forty years of her
reign was Elizabeth's chief minister. As a child Bacon was a
favorite at court, and tradition represents him as something of a
pet of the Queen, who called him "my young Lord Keeper." His mother
was among the most learned women of an age when, among women of
rank, great learning was as common and as highly prized as great
beauty; and her influence was a potent intellectual stimulus to the
boy, although he revolted in early youth from the narrow creed
which her fierce Puritan zeal strove to impose on her household.
Outside of the nursery, the atmosphere of his world was that of
craft, all directed to one end; for the Queen was the source of
honor, power, and wealth, and advancement in life meant only a
share in the grace distributed through her ministers and favorites.
Apart from the harsh and forbidding religious teachings of his
mother, young Francis had before him neither precept nor example of
an ambition more worthy than that of courting the smiles of
power.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a href="images/image208.jpg"><img src=

<br>
<p>At the age of twelve he entered Trinity College, Cambridge
(April, 1573), and left it before he was fifteen (Christmas, 1575);
the institution meanwhile having been broken up for more than half
a year (August, 1574, to March, 1575) by the plague, so that his
intermittent university career summed up less than fourteen months.
There is no record of his studies, and the names of his teachers
are unknown; for though Bacon in later years called himself a pupil
of Whitgift, and his biographers assumed that the relation was
direct and personal, yet that great master of Trinity had certainly
ended his teaching days before Bacon went to Cambridge, and had
entered as Dean of Lincoln on his splendid ecclesiastical career.
University life was very different from that of our times. The
statutes of Cambridge forbade a student, under penalties, to use in
conversation with another any language but Latin, Greek, or Hebrew,
unless in his private apartments and in hours of leisure. It was a
regular custom at Trinity to bring before the assembled
undergraduates every Thursday evening at seven o'clock such junior
students as had been detected in breaches of the rules during the
week, and to flog them. It would be interesting to know in what
languages young Bacon conversed, and what experiences of discipline
befell him; but his subsequent achievements at least suggest that
Cambridge in the sixteenth century may have afforded more efficient
educational influences than our knowledge of its resources and
methods can explain. For it is certain that, at an age when our
most promising youths are beginning serious study, Bacon's mind was
already formed, his habits and modes of research were fixed, the
universe of knowledge was an open field before him. Thenceforth he
was no man's pupil, but in intellectual independence and solitude
he rapidly matured into the supreme scholar of his age.</p>
<p>After registering as a student of law at Gray's Inn, apparently
for the purpose of a nominal connection with a profession which
might aid his patrons in promoting him at court, Bacon was sent in
June, 1576, to France in the train of the British Ambassador, Sir
Amyas Paulet; and for nearly three years followed the roving
embassy around the great cities of that kingdom. The massacre of
St. Bartholomew had taken place four years before, and the boy's
recorded observations on the troubled society of France and of
Europe show remarkable insight into the character of princes and
the sources of political movements. Sir Nicholas had hitherto
directed his son's education and associations with the purpose of
making him an ornament of the court, and had set aside a fund to
provide Francis at the proper time with a handsome estate. But he
died suddenly, February 20th, 1579, without giving legal effect to
this provision, and the sum designed for the young student was
divided equally among the five children, while Francis was excluded
from a share in the rest of the family fortune; and was thus called
home to England to find himself a poor man.</p>
<p>He made himself a bachelor's home at Gray's Inn, and devoted his
energies to the law, with such success that he was soon recognized
as one of the most promising members of the profession. In 1584 he
entered Parliament for Melcombe Regis in Somersetshire, and two
years later sat for Liverpool. During these years the schism
between his inner and his outer life continued to widen. Drawing
his first breath in the atmosphere of the court, bred in the faith
that honor and greatness come from princes' favor, with a native
taste for luxury and magnificence which was fostered by delicate
health, he steadily looked for advancement through the influence of
Burghley and the smiles of the Queen. But Burghley had no sympathy
with speculative thought, and distrusted him for his confidences
concerning his higher studies, while he probably feared in Bacon a
dangerous rival of his own son; so that with expressions of kind
interest, he refrained from giving his nephew practical aid.
Elizabeth, too, suspected that a young man who knew so many things
could not be trusted to know his own business well, and preferred
for important professional work others who were lawyers and nothing
besides. Thus Bacon appeared to the world as a disappointed and
uneasy courtier, struggling to keep up a certain splendor of
appearance and associations under a growing load of debt, and
servile to a Queen on whose caprice his prospects of a career must
depend. His unquestioned power at the bar was exercised only in
minor causes; his eloquence and political dexterity found slow
recognition in Parliament, where they represented only themselves;
and the question whether he would ever be a man of note in the
kingdom seemed for twenty-five years to turn upon what the Crown
might do for its humble suitor.</p>
<p>Meanwhile this laborious advocate and indefatigable courtier,
whose labors at the bar and in attendance upon his great friends
were enough to fill the days of two ordinary men, led his real life
in secret, unknown to the world, and uncomprehended even by the few
in whom he had divined a capacity for great thought, and whom he
had selected for his confidants. From his childhood at the
university, where he felt the emptiness of the Aristotelian logic,
the instrument for attaining truth which traditional learning had
consecrated, he had gradually formed the conception of a more
fruitful process. He had become convinced that the learning of all
past ages was but a poor result of the intellectual capacities and
labors which had been employed upon it; that the human mind had
never yet been properly used; that the methods hitherto adopted in
research were but treadmill work, returning upon itself, or at best
could produce but fragmentary and accidental additions to the sum
of knowledge. All nature is crammed with truth, he believed, which
it concerns man to discover; the intellect of man is constructed
for its discovery, and needs but to be purged of errors of every
kind, and directed in the most efficient employment of its
faculties, to make sure that all the secrets of nature will be
revealed, and its powers made tributary to the health, comfort,
enjoyment, and progressive improvement of mankind.</p>
<p>This stupendous conception, of a revolution which should
transform the world, seems to have taken definite form in Bacon's
mind as early as his twenty-fifth year, when he embodied the
outline of it in a Latin treatise; which he destroyed in later
life, unpublished, as immature, and partly no doubt because he came
to recognize in it an unbecoming arrogance of tone, for its title
was 'Temporis Partus Maximus' (The Greatest Birth of Time.) But six
years later he defines these "vast contemplative ends" in his
famous letter to Burghley, asking for preferment which will enable
him to prosecute his grand scheme and to employ other minds in aid
of it. "For I have taken all knowledge to be my province," he says,
"and if I could purge it of two sorts of rovers, whereof the one
with frivolous disputations, confutations, and verbosities, the
other with blind experiments and auricular traditions and
impostures, hath committed so many spoils, I hope I should bring in
industrious observations, grounded conclusions, and profitable
inventions and discoveries: the best state of that province. This,
whether it be curiosity or vain glory, or nature, or (if one take
it favorably) <i>philanthropia</i> is so fixed in my mind as it
cannot be removed."</p>
<p>This letter reveals the secret of Bacon's life, and all that we
know of him, read in the light of it, forms a consistent and
harmonious whole. He was possessed by his vast scheme, for a
reformation of the intellectual world, and through it, of the world
of human experience, as fully as was ever apostle by his faith.
Implicitly believing in his own ability to accomplish it, at least
in its grand outlines, and to leave at his death the community of
mind at work, by the method and for the purposes which he had
defined, with the perfection of all science in full view, he
subordinated every other ambition to this; and in seeking and
enjoying place, power, and wealth, still regarded them mainly as
aids in prosecuting his master purpose, and in introducing it to
the world. With this clearly in mind, it is easy to understand his
subsequent career. Its external details may be read in any of the
score of biographies which writers of all grades of merit and
demerit have devoted to him, and there is no space for them here.
For our purpose it is necessary to refer only to the principal
crises in his public life.</p>
<p>Until the death of Elizabeth, Bacon had no place in the royal
service worthy of his abilities as a lawyer. Many who, even in the
narrowest professional sense, were far inferior to him, were
preferred before him. Yet he obtained a position recognized by all,
and second only in legal learning to his lifelong rival and
constant adversary, Sir Edward Coke. To-day, it is probable that if
the two greatest names in the history of the common law were to be
selected by the suffrages of the profession, the great majority
would be cast for Coke and Bacon. As a master of the intricacies of
precedent and an authority upon the detailed formulas of "the
perfection of reason," the former is unrivaled still; but in the
comprehensive grasp of the law as a system for the maintenance of
social order and the protection of individual rights, Bacon rose
far above him. The cherished aim of his professional career was to
survey the whole body of the laws of England, to produce a digest
of them which should result in a harmonious code, to do away with
all that was found obsolete or inconsistent with the principles of
the system, and thus to adapt the living, progressive body of the
law to the wants of the growing nation. This magnificent plan was
beyond the power of any one man, had his life no other task, but he
suggested the method and the aim; and while for six generations
after these legal giants passed away, the minute, accurate, and
profound learning of Coke remained the acknowledged chief
storehouse of British traditional jurisprudence, the seventh
generation took up the work of revision and reform, and from the
time of Bentham and Austin the progress of legal science has been
toward codification. The contest between the aggregation of
empirical rules and formulated customs which Coke taught as the
common law, and the broad, harmonious application of scientific
reason to the definition and enforcement of rights, still goes on;
but with constant gains on the side of the reformers, all of whom
with one consent confess that no general and complete
reconstruction of legal doctrine as a science is possible, except
upon the lines laid down by Bacon.</p>
<p>The most memorable case in which Bacon was employed to represent
the Crown during Elizabeth's life was the prosecution of the Earl
of Essex for treason. Essex had been Bacon's friend, patron, and
benefactor; and as long as the earl remained faithful to the Queen
and retained her favor, Bacon served him with ready zeal and
splendid efficiency, and showed himself the wisest and most sincere
of counselors. When Essex rejected his advice, forfeited the
Queen's confidence by the follies from which Bacon had earnestly
striven to deter him, and finally plunged into wanton and reckless
rebellion, Bacon, with whom loyalty to his sovereign had always
been the supreme duty, accepted a retainer from the Crown, and
assisted Coke in the prosecution. The crime of Essex was the
greatest of which a subject was capable; it lacked no circumstance
of aggravation; if the most astounding instance of ingratitude and
disloyalty to friendship ever known is to be sought in that age, it
will be found in the conduct of Essex to Bacon's royal mistress.
Yet writers of eloquence have exhausted their rhetorical powers in
denouncing Bacon's faithlessness to his friend. But no impartial
reader of the full story in the documents of the time can doubt
that throughout these events Bacon did his duty and no more, and
that in doing it he not merely made a voluntary sacrifice of his
popularity, but a far more painful sacrifice of his personal
feelings.</p>
<p>In 1603 James I. came to the throne, and in spite of the efforts
of his most trusted ministers to keep Bacon in obscurity, soon
discovered in him a man whom he needed. In 1607 he was made
Solicitor-General; in 1613 Attorney-General; in March 1617, on the
death of Lord Ellesmere, he received the seals as Lord Keeper; and
in January following was made Lord Chancellor of England. In July
1618 he was raised to the permanent peerage as Baron Verulam, and
in January 1621 received the title of Viscount St. Albans. During
these three years he was the first subject in the kingdom in
dignity, and ought to have been the first in influence. His advice
to the King, and to the Duke of Buckingham who was the King's king,
was always judicious. In certain cardinal points of policy, it was
of the highest statesmanship; and had it been followed, the history
of the Stuart dynasty would have been different, and the Crown and
the Parliament would have wrought together for the good and the
honor of the nation, at least through a generation to come. But the
upstart Buckingham was supreme. He had studied Bacon's strength and
weakness, had laid him under great obligations, had at the same
time attached him by the strongest tie of friendship to his person,
and impressed upon his consciousness the fact that the fate of
Bacon was at all times in his hands. The new Chancellor had entered
on his great office with a fixed purpose to reform its abuses, to
speed and cheapen justice, to free its administration from every
influence of wealth and power. In the first three months of service
he brought up the large arrears of business, tried every cause,
heard every petition, and acquired a splendid reputation as an
upright and diligent judge. But Buckingham was his evil angel. He
was without sense of the sanctity of the judicial character; and
regarded the bench, like every other public office, as an
instrument of his own interests and will. On the other hand, to
Bacon the voice of Buckingham was the voice of the King, and he had
been taught from infancy as the beginning of his political creed
that the king can do no wrong. Buckingham began at once to solicit
from Bacon favors for his friends and dependants, and the
Chancellor was weak enough to listen and to answer him. There is no
evidence that in any one instance the favorite asked for the
violation of law or the perversion of justice; much less that Bacon
would or did accede to such a request. But the Duke demanded for
one suitor a speedy hearing, for another a consideration of facts
which might not be in evidence, for a third all the favor
consistent with law; and Bacon reported to him the result, and how
far he had been able to oblige him. This persistent tampering with
the source of justice was a disturbing influence in the
Chancellor's court, and unquestionably lowered the dignity of his
attitude and weakened his judicial conscience.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this, when the Lord Chancellor opened the
Parliament in January, 1621, with a speech in praise of his King
and in honor of the nation, he seemed to be at the summit of
earthly prosperity. No voice had been lifted to question his purity
and worth. He was the friend of the King, one of the chief supports
of the throne, a champion indeed of high prerogative, but an orator
of power, a writer of fame, whose advancement to the highest
dignities had been welcomed by public opinion. Four months later he
was a convicted criminal, sentenced for judicial corruption to
imprisonment at the King's pleasure, to a fine of &pound;40,000,
and to perpetual incapacity for any public employment. Vicissitudes
of fortune are commonplaces of history. Many a man once seemingly
pinnacled on the top of greatness has "shot from the zenith like a
falling star," and become a proverb of the fickleness of fate. Some
are torn down by the very traits of mind, passion, or temper, which
have raised them: ambition which overleaps itself, rashness which
hazards all on chances it cannot control, vast abilities not great
enough to achieve the impossible. The plunge of Icarus into the
sea, the murder of Caesar, the imprisonment of Coeur de Lion, the
abdication of Napoleon, the apprehension as a criminal of Jefferson
Davis, each was a startling and impressive contrast to the glory
which it followed, yet each was the natural result of causes which
lay in the character and life of the sufferer, and made his story a
consistent whole. But the pathos of Bacon's fall is the sudden
moral ruin of a life which had been built up in honor for sixty
years. An intellect of the first rank, which from boyhood to old
age had been steadfast in the pursuit of truth and in the noblest
services to mankind, which in a feeble body had been sustained in
vigor by all the virtues of prudence and self-reverence; a genial
nature, winning the affection and admiration of associates, hardly
paralleled in the industry with which its energies were devoted to
useful work, a soul exceptional among its contemporaries for piety
and philanthropy--this man is represented to us by popular writers
as having habitually sold justice for money, and as having become
in office "the meanest of mankind."</p>
<p>But this picture, as so often drawn, and as seemingly fixed in
the popular mind, is not only impossible, but is demonstrably
false. To review all the facts which correct it in detail would
lead us far beyond our limits. It must suffice to refer to the
great work of Spedding, in which the entire records of the case are
found, and which would long ago have made the world just to Bacon's
fame, but that the author's comment on his own complete and fair
record is itself partial and extravagant. But the materials for a
final judgment are accessible to all in Spedding's volumes, and a
candid reading of them solves the enigma. Bacon was condemned
without a trial, on his own confession, and this confession was
consistent with the tenor of his life. Its substance was that he
had failed to put a stop effectually to the immemorial custom in
his court of receiving presents from suitors, but that he had never
deviated from justice in his decrees. There was no instance in
which he was accused of yielding to the influence of gifts, or
passing judgment for a bribe. No act of his as Chancellor was
impeached as illegal, or reversed as corrupt. Suitors complained
that they had sent sums of money or valuable presents to his court,
and had been disappointed in the result; but no one complained of
injustice in a decision. Bacon was a conspicuous member of the
royal party; and when the storm of popular fury broke in Parliament
upon the court, the King and the ministry abandoned him. He had
stood all his life upon the royal favor as the basis of his
strength and hope; and when it was gone from under him, he sank
helplessly, and refused to attempt a defense. But he still in his
humiliation found comfort in the reflection that his ruin would put
an end to "anything that is in the likeness of corruption" among
the judges. And he wrote, in the hour of his deepest distress, that
he had been "the justest Chancellor that hath been in the five
changes that have been since Sir Nicholas Bacon's time." Nor did
any man of his time venture to contradict him, when in later years
he summed up his case in the words, "I was the justest judge that
was in England these fifty years. But it was the justest censure in
Parliament that was these two hundred years."</p>
<p>No revolution of modern times has been more complete than that
which the last two centuries have silently wrought in the customary
morality of British public life, and in the standards by which it
is judged. Under James I. every office of state was held as the
private property of its occupant. The highest places in the
government were conferred only on condition of large payments to
the King. He openly sold the honors and dignities of which he was
the source. "The making of a baron," that is, the right to sell to
some rich plebeian a patent of nobility, was a common grant to
favorites, and was actually bestowed on Bacon, to aid him in
maintaining the state of his office. We have the testimony of James
himself that all the lawyers, of whom the judges of the realm were
made, were "so bred and nursed in corruption that they cannot leave
it." But the line between what the King called corruption and that
which he and all his ministers practiced openly and habitually, as
part of the regular work of government, is dim and hard to define.
The mind of the community had not yet firmly grasped the conception
of public office as a trust for the public good, and the general
opinion which stimulates and sustains the official conscience in
holding this trust sacred was still unformed. The courts of justice
were the first branch of the government to feel the pressure of
public opinion, and to respond to the demand for impersonal and
impartial right. But this process had only begun when Bacon, who
had never before served as judge, was called to preside in
Chancery. The Chancellor's office was a gradual development:
originally political and administrative rather than judicial, and
with no salary or reward for hearing causes, save the voluntary
presents of suitors who asked its interference with the ordinary
courts, it step by step became the highest tribunal of the equity
which limits and corrects the routine of law, and still the custom
of gifts was unchecked. A careful study of Bacon's career shows
that in this, as every other branch of thought, his theoretic
convictions were in advance of his age; and in his advice to the
King and in his inaugural promises as Chancellor, he foreshadows
all the principles on which the wisest reformers of the public
service now insist. But he failed to apply them with that heroic
self-sacrifice which alone would have availed him, and the forces
of custom and example continually encroached upon his views of
duty. Having through a long life sought advancement and wealth for
the purpose of using leisure and independence to carry out his
beneficent plans on the largest scale, he eagerly accepted the
traditional emoluments of his new position, in the conviction that
they would become in his hands the means of vast good to mankind.
It was only the public exposure which fully awakened him to a sense
of the inconsistency and wrong of his conduct; and then he was
himself his severest judge, and made every reparation in his power,
by the most unreserved confession, by pointing out the danger to
society of such weakness as his own in language to whose
effectiveness nothing could be added, and by devoting the remainder
of his life to the noblest work for humanity.</p>
<p>During the years of Bacon's splendor as a member of the
government and as spokesman for the throne, his real life as a
thinker, inspired by the loftiest ambition which ever entered the
mind of man, that of creating a new and better civilization, was
not interrupted. It was probably in 1603 that he wrote his
fragmentary 'Prooemium de Interpretatione Naturae,' or 'Preface to
a Treatise on Interpreting Nature,' which is the only piece of
autobiography he has left us. It was found among his papers after
his death; and its candor, dignity, and enthusiasm of tone are in
harmony with the imaginative grasp and magnificent suggestiveness
of its thought. Commending the original Latin to all who can
appreciate its eloquence, we cite the first sentences of it in
English:--</p>
<blockquote>"Believing that I was born for the service of mankind,
and regarding the care of the Commonwealth as a kind of common
property which, like the air and water, belongs to everybody, I set
myself to consider in what way mankind might be best served, and
what service I was myself best fitted by nature to perform.<br>
<br>
"Now, among all the benefits that could be conferred upon mankind,
I found none so great as the discovery of new arts for the
bettering of human life. For I saw that among the rude people of
early times, inventors and discoverers were reckoned as gods. It
was seen that the works of founders of States, law-givers,
tyrant-destroyers, and heroes cover but narrow spaces and endure
but for a time; while the work of the inventor, though of less
pomp, is felt everywhere and lasts forever. But above all, if a man
could, I do not say devise some invention, however useful, but
kindle a light in nature--a light which, even in rising, should
touch and illuminate the borders of existing knowledge, and
spreading further on should bring to light all that is most
secret--that man, in my view, would be indeed the benefactor of
mankind, the extender of man's empire over nature, the champion of
freedom, the conqueror of fate.<br>
<br>
"For myself, I found that I was fitted for nothing so well as for
the study of Truth: as having a mind nimble and versatile enough to
discern resemblances in things (the main point), and yet steady
enough to distinguish the subtle differences in them; as being
endowed with zeal to seek, patience to doubt, love of meditation,
slowness of assertion, readiness to reconsider, carefulness to
arrange and set in order; and as being a man that affects not the
new nor admires the old, but hates all imposture. So I thought my
nature had a certain familiarity and kindred with
Truth."</blockquote>
<p>During the next two years he applied himself to the composition
of the treatise on the 'Advancement of Learning,' the greatest of
his English writings, and one which contains the seed-thoughts and
outline principles of all his philosophy. From the time of its
publication in 1605 to his fall in 1621, he continued to frame the
plan of his 'Great Instauration' of human knowledge, and to write
out chapters, books, passages, sketches, designed to take their
places in it as essential parts. It was to include six great
divisions: first, a general survey of existing knowledge; second, a
guide to the use of the intellect in research, purging it of
sources of error, and furnishing it with the new instrument of
inductive logic by which all the laws of nature might be
ascertained; third, a structure of the phenomena of nature,
included in one hundred and thirty particular branches of natural
history, as the materials for the new logic; fourth, a series of
types and models of the entire mental process of discovering truth,
"selecting various and remarkable instances"; fifth, specimens of
the new philosophy, or anticipations of its results, in fragmentary
contributions to the sixth and crowning division, which was to set
forth the new philosophy in its completeness, comprehending the
truths to be discovered by a perfected instrument of reasoning, in
interpreting all the phenomena of the world. Well aware that the
scheme, especially in its concluding part, was far beyond the power
and time of any one man, he yet hoped to be the architect of the
final edifice of science, by drawing its plans and making them
intelligible, leaving their perfect execution to an intellectual
world which could not fail to be moved to its supreme effort by a
comprehension of the work before it. The 'Novum Organum,' itself
but a fragment of the second division of the 'Instauration,' the
key to the use of the intellect in the discovery of truth, was
published in Latin at the height of his splendor as Lord
Chancellor, in 1620, and is his most memorable achievement in
philosophy. It contains a multitude of suggestive thoughts on the
whole field of science, but is mainly the exposition of the
fallacies by which the intellect is deceived and misled, and from
which it must be purged in order to attain final truth, and of the
new doctrine of "prerogative instances," or crucial observations
and experiments in the work of discovery.</p>
<p>In short, Bacon's entire achievement in science is a plan for an
impossible universe of knowledge. As far as he attempted to advance
particular sciences by applying his method to their detailed
phenomena, he wrought with imperfect knowledge of what had been
done, and with cumbrous and usually misdirected efforts to fill the
gaps he recognized. In a few instances, by what seems an almost
superhuman instinct for truth, rather than the laborious process of
investigation which he taught, he anticipated brilliant discoveries
of later centuries. For example, he clearly pointed out the
necessity of regarding heat as a form of motion in the molecules of
matter, and thus foreshadowed, without any conception of the means
of proving it, that which, for investigators of the nineteenth
century, has proved the most direct way to the secrets of nature.
But the testimony of the great teachers of science is unanimous,
that Bacon was not a skilled observer of phenomena, nor a
discoverer of scientific inductions; that he contributed no
important new truth, in the sense of an established law, to any
department of knowledge; and that his method of research and
reasoning is not, in its essential features, that which is
fruitfully pursued by them in extending the boundaries of science,
nor was his mind wholly purged of those "idols of the cave," or
forms of personal bias, whose varying forms as hindrances to the
"dry light" of sound reason he was the first to expose. He never
appreciated the mathematics as the basis of physics, but valued
their elements mainly as a mental discipline. Astronomy meant
little to him, since he failed to connect it directly with human
well-being and improvement; to the system of Copernicus, the
beginning of our insight into the heavens, he was hostile, or at
least indifferent; and the splendid discoveries successively made
by Tycho Brahe, Galileo, and Kepler, and brought to his ears while
the 'Great Instauration' filled his mind and heart, met with but a
feeble welcome with him, or none. Why is it, then, that Bacon's is
the foremost name in the history of English, and perhaps, as many
insist, of all modern thought? Why is it that "the Baconian
philosophy" is another phrase, in all the languages of Europe, for
that splendid development of the study and knowledge of the visible
universe which since his time has changed the life of mankind?</p>
<p>A candid answer to these questions will expose an error as wide
in the popular estimate of Bacon's intellectual greatness as that
which has prevailed so generally regarding his character. He is
called the inventor of inductive reasoning, the reformer of logic,
the lawgiver of the world of thought; but he was no one of these.
His grasp of the inductive method was defective; his logic was
clumsy and impractical; his plan for registering all phenomena and
selecting and generalizing from them, making the discovery of truth
almost a mechanical process, was worthless. In short, it is not as
a philosopher nor as a man of science that Bacon has carved his
name in the high places of enduring fame, but rather as a man of
letters; as on the whole the greatest writer of the modern world,
outside of the province of imaginative art; as the Shakespeare of
English prose. Does this seem a paradox to the reader who remembers
that Bacon distrusted all modern languages, and thought to make his
'Advancement of Learning' "live, and be a citizen of the world," by
giving it a Latin form? That his lifelong ambition was to
reconstruct methods of thought, and guide intellect in the way of
work serviceable to comfort and happiness? That the books in which
his English style appears in its perfection, the 'History of Henry
VII.,' the 'Essays,' and the papers on public affairs, were but
incidents and avocations of a life absorbed by a master
purpose?</p>
<p>But what is literature? It is creative mind, addressing itself
in worthy expression to the common receptive mind of mankind. Its
note is universality, as distinguished from all that is technical,
limited, and narrow. Thought whose interest is as broad as
humanity, suitably clothed in the language of real life, and thus
fitted for access to the general intelligence, constitutes true
literature, to the exclusion of that which, by its nature or by its
expression, appeals only to a special class or school. The 'Opus
Anglicanum' of Duns Scotus, Newton's 'Principia,' Lavoisier's
treatise 'Sur la Combustion,' Kant's 'Kritik der Reinen Vernunft'
(Critique of Pure Reason), each made an epoch in some vast domain
of knowledge or belief; but none of them is literature. Yet the
thoughts they, through a limited and specially trained class of
students, introduced to the world, were gradually taken up into the
common stock of mankind, and found their broad, effective, complete
expression in the literature of after generations. If we apply this
test to Bacon's life work, we shall find sufficient justification
for honoring him above all special workers in narrower fields, as
next to Shakespeare the greatest name in the greatest period of
English literature.</p>
<p>It was not as an experimenter, investigator, or technical
teacher, but as a thinker and a writer, that he rendered his great
service to the world. This consisted essentially in the
contribution of two magnificent ideas to the common stock of
thought: the idea of the utility of science, as able to subjugate
the forces of nature to the use of man; and the idea of continued
and boundless progress in the comfort and happiness of the
individual life, and in the order and dignity of human society. It
has been shown how, from early manhood, he was inspired by the
conception of infinite resources in the material world, for the
discovery and employment of which the human mind is adapted. He
never wearied of pointing out the imperfection and fruitlessness of
the methods of inquiry and of invention hitherto in use, and the
splendid results which could be rapidly attained if a combined and
systematic effort were made to enlarge the boundaries of knowledge.
This led him directly to the conception of an improved and
advancing civilization; to the utterance, in a thousand varied,
impressive, and fascinating forms, of that idea of human progress
which is the inspiration, the characteristic, and the hope of the
modern world. Bacon was the first of men to grasp these ideas in
all their comprehensiveness as feasible purposes, as practical
aims; to teach the development of them as the supreme duty and
ambition of his contemporaries, and to look forward instead of
behind him for the Golden Age. Enforcing and applying these
thoughts with a wealth of learning, a keenness of wit, a soundness
of judgment, and a suggestiveness of illustration unequaled by any
writer before him, he became the greatest literary power of modern
times to stimulate minds in every department of life to their
noblest efforts and their worthiest achievements.</p>
<p>Literature has a twofold aspect: its ideal is pure truth, which
is the noblest thought embodied in perfect beauty of form. It is
the union of science and art, the final wedding in which are merged
the knowledge worthy to be known and the highest imagination
presenting it. There is a school calling itself that of pure art,
to which substance is nothing and form is everything. Its measure
of merit is applied to the manner only; and the meanest of
subjects, the most trivial and even the most degraded of ideas or
facts, is welcomed to its high places if clothed in a satisfying
garb. But this school, though arrogant in the other arts of
expression, has not yet been welcomed to the judgment-seat in
literature, where indeed it is passing even now to contempt and
oblivion. Bacon's instinct was for substance. His strongest passion
was for utility. The artistic side of his nature was receptive
rather than creative. Splendid passages in the 'Advancement' and
'De Augmentis' show his profound appreciation of all the arts of
expression, but show likewise his inability to glorify them above
that which they express. In his mind, language is subordinate to
thought, and the painting to the picture, just as the frame is to
the painting or the binding to the book. He writes always in the
grand style. He reminds us of "the large utterance of the early
gods." His sentences are weighted with thought, as suggestive as
Plato, as condensed as Thucydides. Full of wit, keen in discerning
analogies, rich in intellectual ornament, he is yet too
concentrated in his attention to the idea to care for the melody of
language. He decorates with fruits, not with flowers. For metrical
movement, for rhythmic harmony, he has no ear nor sense.
Inconceivable as it is that Shakespeare could have written one
aphorism of the 'Novum Organum,' it would be far more absurd to
imagine Bacon writing a line of the Sonnets. With the loftiest
imagination, the liveliest fancy, the keenest sense of precision
and appropriateness in words, he lacks the special gift of poetic
form, the faculty divine which finds new inspiration in the very
limitations of measured language, and whose natural expression is
music alike to the ear and to the mind. His powers were cramped by
the fetters of metre, and his attempts to versify even rich thought
and deep feeling were puerile. But his prose is by far the
weightiest, the most lucid, effective, and pleasing of his day. The
poet Sprat justly says:--</p>
<blockquote>"He was a man of strong, clear, and powerful
imaginations; his genius was searching and inimitable; and of this
I need give no other proof than his style itself, which as for the
most part it describes men's minds as well as pictures do their
bodies, so it did his above all men living."</blockquote>
<p>And Ben Jonson, who knew him well, describes his eloquence in
terms which are confirmed by all we know of his Parliamentary
career:--</p>
<blockquote>"One, though he be excellent and the chief, is not to
be imitated alone; for no imitator ever grew up to his author:
likeness is always on this side truth. Yet there happened in my
time one noble speaker, who was full of gravity in his speaking.
His language (when he could spare or pass by a jest) was nobly
censorious. No man ever spake more neatly, more rightly, more
weightily, or suffered less emptiness, less idleness in what he
uttered. No member of his speech but consisted of his own graces.
His hearers could not cough or look aside from him without loss. He
commanded when he spoke, and had his judges angry and pleased at
his devotion. No man had their affections more in his power. The
fear of every man that heard him was lest he should make an
end."</blockquote>
<p>The speeches of Bacon are almost wholly lost, his philosophy is
an undeciphered heap of fragments, the ambitions of his life lay in
ruins about his dishonored old age; yet his intellect is one of the
great moving and still vital forces of the modern world, and he
remains, for all ages to come, in the literature which is the final
storehouse of the chief treasures of mankind, one of</p>
"The dead yet sceptered sovereigns who still rule<br>
Our spirits from their urns."<br>

<h3>OF TRUTH</h3>
<center>From the 'Essays'</center>
<p>What is Truth? said jesting Pilate; and would not stay for an
answer. Certainly there be that delight in giddiness; and count it
a bondage to fix a belief; affecting free-will in thinking, as well
as in acting. And though the sects of philosophers of that kind be
gone, yet there remain certain discoursing wits, which are of the
same veins, though there be not so much blood in them as was in
those of the ancients. But it is not only the difficulty and labor
which men take in finding out of truth, nor again, that when it is
found it imposeth upon men's thoughts, that doth bring lies in
favor: but a natural though corrupt love of the lie itself. One of
the later school of the Grecians examineth the matter, and is at a
stand to think what should be in it, that men should love lies,
where neither they make for pleasure as with poets, nor for
advantage as with the merchant; but for the lie's sake. But I
cannot tell: this same truth is a naked and open daylight, that
doth not show the masks and mummeries and triumphs of the world
half so stately and daintily as candle-lights. Truth may perhaps
come to the price of a pearl, that showeth best by day; but it will
not rise to the price of a diamond or carbuncle, that showeth best
in varied lights. A mixture of a lie doth ever add pleasure. Doth
any man doubt, that if there were taken out of men's minds vain
opinions, flattering hopes, false valuations, imaginations as one
would, and the like, but it would leave the minds of a number of
men poor shrunken things, full of melancholy and indisposition, and
unpleasing to themselves? One of the fathers, in great severity,
called poesy <i>vinum doemonum,</i> because it filleth the
imagination, and yet it is but with the shadow of a lie. But it is
not the lie that passeth through the mind, but the lie that sinketh
in and settleth in it, that doth the hurt; such as we spake of
before. But howsoever these things are thus in men's depraved
judgments and affections, yet truth, which only doth judge itself,
teacheth that the inquiry of truth, which is the love-making or
wooing of it, the knowledge of truth, which is the presence of it,
and the belief of truth, which is the enjoying of it, is the
sovereign good of human nature. The first creature of God, in the
works of the days, was the light of the sense; the last was the
light of reason; and his Sabbath work ever since is the
illumination of his Spirit.... The poet that beautified the sect
that was otherwise inferior to the rest, saith yet excellently
well:--"It is a pleasure to stand upon the shore, and to see ships
tossed upon the sea; a pleasure to stand in the window of a castle,
and to see a battle and the adventures thereof below; but no
pleasure is comparable to the standing upon the vantage ground of
Truth" (a hill not to be commanded, and where the air is always
clear and serene). "and to see the errors, and wanderings, and
mists, and tempests, in the vale below:" so always that this
prospect be with pity, and not with swelling or pride. Certainly,
it is heaven upon earth, to have a man's mind move in charity, rest
in providence, and turn upon the poles of truth.</p>
<p>To pass from theological and philosophical truth to the truth of
civil business: it will be acknowledged even by those that practice
it not, that clear and round dealing is the honor of man's nature,
and that mixture of falsehood is like alloy in coin of gold and
silver, which may make the metal work the better, but it embaseth
it. For these winding and crooked courses are the goings of the
serpent; which goeth basely upon the belly, and not upon the feet.
There is no vice that doth so cover a man with shame as to be found
false and perfidious; and therefore Montaigne saith prettily, when
he inquired the reason why the word of the lie should be such a
disgrace and such an odious charge. Saith he, "If it be well
weighed, to say that a man lieth, is as much as to say that he is
brave toward God and a coward toward men." For a lie faces God, and
shrinks from man. Surely the wickedness of falsehood and breach of
faith cannot possibly be so highly expressed, as in that it shall
be the last peal to call the judgments of God upon the generations
of men; it being foretold, that when Christ cometh, "he shall not
find faith upon the earth."</p>

<a name="BACON_2"></a>
<h3>OF REVENGE</h3>
<center>From the 'Essays'</center>
<p>Revenge is a kind of wild justice; which the more man's nature
runs to, the more ought law to weed it out. For as for the first
wrong, it doth but offend the law; but the revenge of that wrong
putteth the law out of office. Certainly, in taking revenge, a man
is but even with his enemy; but in passing it over, he is superior:
for it is a prince's part to pardon, and Solomon, I am sure, saith,
"It is the glory of a man to pass by an offense." That which is
past is gone and irrevocable, and wise men have enough to do with
things present and to come; therefore, they do but trifle with
themselves that labor in past matters. There is no man doth a wrong
for the wrong's sake; but thereby to purchase himself profit, or
pleasure, or honor, or the like. Therefore, why should I be angry
with a man for loving himself better than me? And if any man should
do wrong merely out of ill-nature, why yet it is but like the thorn
or brier, which prick and scratch because they can do no other. The
most tolerable sort of revenge is for those wrongs which there is
no law to remedy; but then, let a man take heed the revenge be such
as there is no law to punish, else a man's enemy is still
beforehand, and it is two for one. Some, when they take revenge,
are desirous the party should know whence it cometh. This is the
more generous; for the delight seemeth to be not so much in doing
the hurt as in making the party repent. But base and crafty cowards
are like the arrow that flieth in the dark. Cosmus, Duke of
Florence, had a desperate saying against perfidious or neglecting
friends, as if those wrongs were unpardonable. "You shall read,"
saith he, "that we are commanded to forgive our enemies; but you
never read that we are commanded to forgive our friends." But yet
the spirit of Job was in a better tune: "Shall we," saith he, "take
good at God's hands, and not be content to take evil also?" And so
of friends in a proportion. This is certain, that a man that
studieth revenge keeps his own wounds green, which otherwise would
heal and do well. Public revenges are for the most part fortunate:
as that for the death of Caesar; for the death of Pertinax; for the
death of Henry the Third of France; and many more. But in private
revenges it is not so. Nay, rather vindictive persons live the life
of witches; who, as they are mischievous, so end they
infortunate.</p>

<h3>OF SIMULATION AND DISSIMULATION</h3>
<center>From the 'Essays'</center>
<p>Dissimulation is but a faint kind of policy or wisdom; for it
asketh a strong wit and a strong heart to know when to tell truth,
and to do it. Therefore it is the weaker sort of politicians that
are the great dissemblers.</p>
<p>Tacitus saith, "Livia sorted well with the arts of her husband
and dissimulation of her son;" attributing arts of policy to
Augustus, and dissimulation to Tiberius. And again, when Mucianus
encourageth Vespasian to take arms against Vitellius, he saith, "We
rise not against the piercing judgment of Augustus, nor the extreme
caution or closeness of Tiberius." These properties of arts or
policy, and dissimulation or closeness, are indeed habits and
faculties several, and to be distinguished. For if a man have that
penetration of judgment as he can discern what things are to be
laid open, and what to be secreted, and what to be showed at
half-lights, and to whom and when, (which indeed are arts of state
and arts of life, as Tacitus well calleth them,) to him a habit of
dissimulation is a hindrance and a poorness. But if a man cannot
obtain to that judgment, then it is left to him generally to be
close, and a dissembler. For where a man cannot choose or vary in
particulars, there it is good to take the safest and wariest way in
general; like the going softly, by one that cannot well see.
Certainly the ablest men that ever were, have had all an openness
and frankness of dealing, and a name of certainty and veracity: but
then they were like horses well managed, for they could tell
passing well when to stop or turn; and at such times when they
thought the case indeed required dissimulation, if then they used
it, it came to pass that the former opinion spread abroad of their
good faith and clearness of dealing made them almost invisible.</p>
<p>There be three degrees of this hiding and veiling of a man's
self. The first, Closeness, Reservation, and Secrecy; when a man
leaveth himself without observation, or without hold to be taken,
what he is. The second, Dissimulation, in the negative; when a man
lets fall signs and arguments, that he is not that he is. And the
third, Simulation, in the affirmative; when a man industriously and
expressly feigns and pretends to be that he is not.</p>
<p>For the first of these, Secrecy: it is indeed the virtue of a
confessor. And assuredly the secret man heareth many confessions;
for who will open himself to a blab or a babbler? But if a man be
thought secret, it inviteth discovery, as the more close air
sucketh in the more open; and as in confession the revealing is not
for worldly use, but for the ease of a man's heart, so secret men
come to the knowledge of many things in that kind: while men rather
discharge their minds than impart their minds. In few words,
mysteries are due to secrecy. Besides (to say truth), nakedness is
uncomely, as well in mind as body; and it addeth no small reverence
to men's manners and actions, if they be not altogether open. As
for talkers and futile persons, they are commonly vain and
credulous withal; for he that talketh what he knoweth, will also
talk what he knoweth not. Therefore set it down, that a habit of
secrecy is both politic and moral. And in this part it is good that
a man's face give his tongue leave to speak; for the discovery of a
man's self by the tracts of his countenance is a great weakness and
betraying, by how much it is many times more marked and believed
than a man's words.</p>
<p>For the second, which is Dissimulation: it followeth many times
upon secrecy by a necessity; so that he that will be secret must be
a dissembler in some degree. For men are too cunning to suffer a
man to keep an indifferent carriage between both, and to be secret,
without swaying the balance on either side. They will so beset a
man with questions, and draw him on, and pick it out of him, that
without an absurd silence, he must show an inclination one way; or
if he do not, they will gather as much by his silence as by his
speech. As for equivocations, or oraculous speeches, they cannot
hold out long. So that no man can be secret, except he give himself
a little scope of dissimulation; which is, as it were, but the
skirts or train of secrecy.</p>
<p>But for the third degree, which is Simulation and false
profession: that I hold more culpable and less politic, except it
be in great and rare matters. And therefore a general custom of
simulation (which is this last degree) is a vice rising either of a
natural falseness or fearfulness, or of a mind that hath some main
faults; which because a man must needs disguise, it maketh him
practice simulation in other things, lest his hand should be out of
use.</p>
<p>The great advantages of simulation and dissimulation are three.
First, to lay asleep opposition, and to surprise; for where a man's
intentions are published, it is an alarum to call up all that are
against them. The second is, to reserve to a man's self a fair
retreat; for if a man engage himself by a manifest declaration, he
must go through or take a fall. The third is, the better to
discover the mind of another; for to him that opens himself men
will hardly show themselves adverse, but will fair let him go on,
and turn their freedom of speech to freedom of thought. And
therefore it is a good shrewd proverb of the Spaniard, "Tell a lie
and find a troth;" as if there were no way of discovery but by
simulation. There be also three disadvantages to set it even. The
first, that simulation and dissimulation commonly carry with them a
show of fearfulness; which in any business doth spoil the feathers
of round flying up to the mark. The second, that it puzzleth and
perplexeth the conceits of many that perhaps would otherwise
co-operate with him, and makes a man walk almost alone to his own
ends. The third and greatest is, that it depriveth a man of one of
the most principal instruments for action; which is trust and
belief. The best composition and temperature is, to have openness
in fame and opinion; secrecy in habit; dissimulation in seasonable
use; and a power to feign if there be no remedy.</p>

<h3>OF TRAVEL</h3>
<center>From the 'Essays'</center>
<p>Travel, in the younger sort, is a part of education; in the
elder, a part of experience. He that traveleth into a country
before he hath some entrance into the language, goeth to school,
and not to travel. That young men travel under some tutor or grave
servant, I allow well: so that he be such a one that hath the
language, and hath been in the country before; whereby he may be
able to tell them what things are worthy to be seen in the country
where they go, what acquaintances they are to seek, what exercises
or discipline the place yielded. For else young men shall go
hooded, and look abroad little. It is a strange thing, that in sea
voyages, where there is nothing to be seen but sky and sea, men
should make diaries; but in land travel, wherein so much is to be
observed, for the most part they omit it; as if chance were fitter
to be registered than observation. Let diaries therefore be brought
in use. The things to be seen and observed are, the courts of
princes, specially when they give audience to ambassadors; the
courts of justice, while they sit and hear causes; and so of
consistories ecclesiastic; the churches and monasteries, with the
monuments which are therein extant; the walls and fortifications of
cities and towns, and so the havens and harbors; antiquities and
ruins; libraries; colleges, disputations, and lectures, where any
are; shipping and navies; houses and gardens of state and pleasure,
near great cities; armories; arsenals; magazines; exchanges;
burses; warehouses; exercises of horsemanship, fencing, training of
soldiers, and the like; comedies, such whereunto the better sort of
persons do resort; treasuries of jewels and robes; cabinets and
rarities: and, to conclude, whatsoever is memorable in the places
where they go. After all which the tutors or servants ought to make
diligent inquiry. As for triumphs, masks, feasts, weddings,
funerals, capital executions, and such shows, men need not to be
put in mind of them: yet are they not to be neglected. If you will
have a young man to put his travel into a little room, and in short
time to gather much, this you must do. First, as was said, he must
have some entrance into the language before he goeth. Then he must
have such a servant or tutor as knoweth the country, as was
likewise said. Let him carry with him also some card or book,
describing the country where he traveleth, which will be a good key
to his inquiry. Let him keep also a diary. Let him not stay long in
one city or town; more or less as the place deserveth, but not
long: nay, when he stayeth in one city or town, let him change his
lodging from one end and part of the town to another; which is a
great adamant of acquaintance. Let him sequester himself from the
company of his countrymen, and diet in such places where there is
good company of the nation where he traveleth. Let him upon his
removes from one place to another, procure recommendation to some
person of quality residing in the place whither he removeth; that
he may use his favor in those things he desireth to see or know.
Thus he may abridge his travel with much profit.</p>
<p>As for the acquaintance which is to be sought in travel: that
which is most of all profitable, is acquaintance with the
secretaries and employed men of ambassadors; for so in traveling in
one country he shall suck the experience of many. Let him also see
and visit eminent persons in all kinds, which are of great name
abroad; that he may be able to tell how the life agreeth with the
fame. For quarrels, they are with care and discretion to be
avoided. They are commonly for mistresses, healths, place, and
words. And let a man beware how he keepeth company with choleric
and quarrelsome persons; for they will engage him into their own
quarrels. When a traveler returneth home, let him not leave the
countries where he hath traveled altogether behind him, but
maintain a correspondence by letters with those of his acquaintance
which are of most worth. And let his travel appear rather in his
discourse than in his apparel or gesture; and in his discourse let
him be rather advised in his answers, than forward to tell stories;
and let it appear that he doth not change his country manners for
those of foreign parts; but only prick in some flowers of that he
hath learned abroad into the customs of his own country.</p>

<h3>OF FRIENDSHIP</h3>
<center>From the 'Essays'</center>
<p>It had been hard for him that spake it to have put more truth
and untruth together in few words than in that speech, "Whosoever
is delighted in solitude is either a wild beast or a god." For it
is most true that a natural and secret hatred and aversion toward
society in any man hath somewhat of the savage beast; but it is
most untrue that it should have any character at all of the divine
nature, except it proceed, not out of a pleasure in solitude, but
out of a love and desire to sequester a man's self for a higher
conversation: such as is found to have been falsely and feignedly
in some of the heathen, as Epimenides the Candian, Numa the Roman,
Empedocles the Sicilian, and Apollonius of Tyana; and truly and
really in divers of the ancient hermits and holy fathers of the
Church. But little do men perceive what solitude is, and how far it
extendeth. For a crowd is not company; and faces are but a gallery
of pictures; and talk but a tinkling cymbal, where there is no
love. The Latin adage meeteth with it a little: "Magna civitas,
magna solitudo;" because in a great town friends are scattered, so
that there is not that fellowship, for the most part, which is in
less neighborhoods. But we may go further, and affirm most truly
that it is a mere and miserable solitude to want true friends,
without which the world is but a wilderness; and even in this sense
also of solitude, whosoever in the frame of his nature and
affections is unfit for friendship, he taketh it of the beast, and
not from humanity.</p>
<p>A principal fruit of friendship is the ease and discharge of the
fullness and swellings of the heart, which passions of all kinds do
cause and induce. We know diseases of stoppings and suffocations
are the most dangerous in the body; and it is not much otherwise in
the mind. You may take sarza to open the liver, steel to open the
spleen, flower of sulphur for the lungs, castoreum for the brain:
but no receipt openeth the heart but a true friend; to whom you may
impart griefs, joys, fears, hopes, suspicions, counsels, and
whatsoever lieth upon the heart to oppress it, in a kind of civil
shrift or confession.</p>
<p>It is a strange thing to observe how high a rate great kings and
monarchs do set upon this fruit of friendship whereof we speak; so
great, as they purchase it many times at the hazard of their own
safety and greatness. For princes, in regard of the distance of
their fortune from that of their subjects and servants, cannot
gather this fruit, except (to make themselves capable thereof) they
raise some persons to be as it were companions and almost equals to
themselves; which many times sorteth to inconvenience. The modern
languages give unto such persons the name of favorites, or
privadoes; as if it were matter of grace or conversation. But the
Roman name attaineth the true use and cause thereof, naming them
"participes curarum"; for it is that which tieth the knot. And we
see plainly that this hath been done, not by weak and passionate
princes only, but by the wisest and most politic that ever reigned;
who have oftentimes joined to themselves some of their servants,
whom both themselves have called friends, and allowed others
likewise to call them in the same manner, using the word which is
received between private men.</p>
<p>L. Sylla, when he commanded Rome, raised Pompey (after surnamed
the Great) to that height that Pompey vaunted himself for Sylla's
overmatch. For when he had carried the consulship for a friend of
his against the pursuit of Sylla, and that Sylla did a little
resent thereat, and began to speak great, Pompey turned upon him
again, and in effect bade him be quiet; "for that more men adored
the sun rising than the sun setting." With Julius Caesar, Decimus
Brutus had obtained that interest, as he set him down in his
testament for heir in remainder after his nephew; and this was the
man that had power with him to draw him forth to his death. For
when Caesar would have discharged the Senate in regard of some ill
presages, and specially a dream of Calpurnia, this man lifted him
gently by the arm out of his chair, telling him he hoped he would
not dismiss the Senate till his wife had dreamt a better dream. And
it seemeth his favor was so great as Antonius, in a letter which is
recited verbatim in one of Cicero's Philippics, calleth him
"venefica"--"witch"; as if he had enchanted Caesar. Augustus raised
Agrippa (though of mean birth) to that height as, when he consulted
with Maecenas about the marriage of his daughter Julia, Maecenas
took the liberty to tell him, "that he must either marry his
daughter to Agrippa or take away his life: there was no third way,
he had made him so great." With Tiberius Caesar, Sejanus had
ascended to that height as they two were termed and reckoned as a
pair of friends. Tiberius in a letter to him saith, "Haec pro
amicitia nostra non occultavi" [these things, from our friendship,
I have not concealed from you]; and the whole Senate dedicated an
altar to Friendship, as to a goddess, in respect of the great
dearness of friendship between them two. The like, or more, was
between Septimius Severus and Plautianus. For he forced his eldest
son to marry the daughter of Plautianus; and would often maintain
Plautianus in doing affronts to his son; and did write also, in a
letter to the Senate, by these words: "I love the man so well, as I
wish he may over-live me." Now, if these princes had been as a
Trajan or a Marcus Aurelius, a man might have thought that this had
proceeded of an abundant goodness of nature; but being men so wise,
of such strength and severity of mind, and so extreme lovers of
themselves, as all these were, it proveth most plainly that they
found their own felicity (though as great as ever happened to
mortal men) but as an half-piece, except they might have a friend
to make it entire: and yet, which is more, they were princes that
had wives, sons, nephews; and yet all these could not supply the
comfort of friendship.</p>
<p>It is not to be forgotten what Comineus observeth of his first
master, Duke Charles the Hardy; namely, that he would communicate
his secrets with none, and least of all those secrets which
troubled him most. Whereupon he goeth on and saith, that toward his
latter time "that closeness did impair and a little perish his
understanding." Surely Comineus mought have made the same judgment
also, if it had pleased him, of his second master Louis the
Eleventh, whose closeness was indeed his tormentor. The parable of
Pythagoras is dark, but true: "Cor ne edito,"--"Eat not the heart."
Certainly, if a man would give it a hard phrase, those that want
friends to open themselves unto are cannibals of their own hearts.
But one thing is most admirable (wherewith I will conclude this
first fruit of friendship), which is, that this communicating of a
man's self to his friend works two contrary effects; for it
redoubleth joys, and cutteth griefs in halves. For there is no man
that imparteth his joys to his friend, but he joyeth the more; and
no man that imparteth his griefs to his friend, but he grieveth the
less. So that it is, in truth, of operation upon a man's mind of
like virtue as the alchymists use to attribute to their stone for
man's body; that it worketh all contrary effects, but still to the
good and benefit of nature. But yet without praying in aid of
alchymists, there is a manifest image of this in the ordinary
course of nature: for in bodies, union strengtheneth and cherisheth
any natural action, and on the other side, weakeneth and dulleth
any violent impression; and even so it is of minds.</p>
<p>The second fruit of friendship is healthful and sovereign for
the understanding, as the first is for the affections. For
friendship maketh indeed a fair day in the affections, from storm
and tempests, but it maketh daylight in the understanding, out of
darkness and confusion of thoughts. Neither is this to be
understood only of faithful counsel, which a man receiveth from his
friend; but before you come to that, certain it is that whosoever
hath his mind fraught with many thoughts, his wits and
understanding do clarify and break up in the communicating and
discoursing with another; he tosseth his thoughts more easily; he
marshaleth them more orderly; he seeth how they look when they are
turned into words; finally, he waxeth wiser than himself; and that
more by an hour's discourse than by a day's meditation. It was well
said by Themistocles to the King of Persia, "That speech was like
cloth of Arras, opened and put abroad; whereby the imagery doth
appear in figure: whereas in thoughts they lie but as in packs."
Neither is this second fruit of friendship, in opening the
understanding, restrained only to such friends as are able to give
a man counsel (they indeed are best); but even without that, a man
learneth of himself, and bringeth his own thoughts to light, and
whetteth his wits as against a stone, which itself cuts not. In a
word, a man were better relate himself to a statue or picture, than
to suffer his thoughts to pass in smother.</p>
<p>Add now, to make this second fruit of friendship complete, that
other point which lieth more open, and falleth within vulgar
observation; which is faithful counsel from a friend. Heraclitus
saith well in one of his enigmas, "Dry light is ever the best;" and
certain it is, that the light that a man receiveth by counsel from
another, is drier and purer than that which cometh from his own
understanding and judgment; which is ever infused and drenched in
his affections and customs. So as there is as much difference
between the counsel that a friend giveth, and that a man giveth
himself, as there is between the counsel of a friend and of a
flatterer; for there is no such flatterer as is a man's self, and
there is no such remedy against flattery of a man's self as the
liberty of a friend. Counsel is of two sorts: the one concerning
manners, the other concerning business. For the first, the best
preservative to keep the mind in health is the faithful admonition
of a friend. The calling of a man's self to a strict account is a
medicine sometimes too piercing and corrosive; reading good books
of morality is a little flat and dead; observing our faults in
others is sometimes improper for our case: but the best receipt
(best I say to work and best to take) is the admonition of a
friend. It is a strange thing to behold what gross errors and
extreme absurdities many (especially of the greater sort) do commit
for want of a friend to tell them of them, to the great damage both
of their fame and fortune: for, as St. James saith, they are as men
"that look sometimes into a glass, and presently forget their own
shape and favor." As for business, a man may think, if he will,
that two eyes see no more than one; or, that a gamester seeth
always more than a looker-on; or, that a man in anger is as wise as
he that hath said over the four-and-twenty letters; or, that a
musket may be shot off as well upon the arm as upon a rest; and
such other fond and high imaginations, to think himself all in all:
but when all is done, the help of good counsel is that which
setteth business straight: and if any man think that he will take
counsel, but it shall be by pieces; asking counsel in one business
of one man, and in another business of another man, it is well
(that is to say, better, perhaps, than if he asked none at all);
but he runneth two dangers: one, that he shall not be faithfully
counseled; for it is a rare thing, except it be from a perfect and
entire friend, to have counsel given, but such as shall be bowed
and crooked to some ends which he hath that giveth it: the other,
that he shall have counsel given, hurtful and unsafe (though with
good meaning), and mixed partly of mischief, and partly of remedy;
even as if you would call a physician, that is thought good for the
cure of the disease you complain of, but is unacquainted with your
body; and therefore may put you in a way for a present cure, but
overthroweth your health in some other kind, and so cure the
disease and kill the patient: but a friend that is wholly
acquainted with a man's estate will beware, by furthering any
present business, how he dasheth upon the other inconvenience. And
therefore, rest not upon scattered counsels: they will rather
distract and mislead, than settle and direct.</p>
<p>After these two noble fruits of friendship (peace in the
affections, and support of the judgment), followeth the last fruit,
which is like the pomegranate, full of many kernels; I mean aid,
and bearing a part in all actions and occasions. Here the best way
to represent to life the manifold use of friendship, is to cast and
see how many things there are which a man cannot do himself: and
then it will appear that it was a sparing speech of the ancients to
say, "that a friend is another himself;" for that a friend is far
more than himself. Men have their time, and die many times in
desire of some things which they principally take to heart; the
bestowing of a child, the finishing of a work, or the like. If a
man have a true friend, he may rest almost secure that the care of
those things will continue after him; so that a man hath, as it
were, two lives in his desires. A man hath a body, and that body is
confined to a place; but where friendship is, all offices of life
are, as it were, granted to him and his deputy; for he may exercise
them by his friend. How many things are there, which a man cannot,
with any face or comeliness, say or do himself; A man can scarce
allege his own merits with modesty, much less extol them; a man
cannot sometimes brook to supplicate, or beg, and a number of the
like: but all these things are graceful in a friend's mouth, which
are blushing in a man's own. So again, a man's person hath many
proper relations which he cannot put off. A man cannot speak to his
son but as a father; to his wife but as a husband; to his enemy but
upon terms: whereas a friend may speak as the case requires, and
not as it sorteth with the person: but to enumerate these things
were endless; I have given the rule, where a man cannot fitly play
his own part, if he have not a friend he may quit the stage.</p>

<h3>DEFECTS OF THE UNIVERSITIES</h3>
<center>From 'The Advancement of Learning' (Book ii.)</center>
<p>Amongst so many great foundations of colleges in Europe, I find
it strange that they are all dedicated to professions, and none
left free to arts and sciences at large. For if men judge that
learning should be referred to action, they judge well: but in this
they fall into the error described in the ancient fable, in which
the other parts of the body did suppose the stomach had been idle,
because it neither performed the office of motion, as the limbs do,
nor of sense, as the head doth; but yet notwithstanding it is the
stomach that digesteth and distributeth to all the rest. So if any
man think philosophy and universality to be idle studies, he doth
not consider that all professions are from thence served and
supplied. And this I take to be a great cause that hath hindered
the progression of learning, because these fundamental knowledges
have been studied but in passage. For if you will have a tree bear
more fruit than it hath used to do, it is not anything you can do
to the boughs, but it is the stirring of the earth and putting new
mold about the roots that must work it. Neither is it to be
forgotten, that this dedicating of foundations and dotations to
professory learning hath not only had a malign aspect and influence
upon the growth of sciences, but hath also been prejudicial to
States and governments. For hence it proceedeth that princes find a
solitude in regard of able men to serve them in causes of estate,
because there is no education collegiate which is free; where such
as were so disposed mought give themselves to histories, modern
languages, books of policy and civil discourse, and other the like
enablements unto service of estate.</p>
<p>And because founders of colleges do plant, and founders of
lectures do water, it followeth well in order to speak of the
defect which is in public lectures; namely, in the smallness and
meanness of the salary or reward which in most places is assigned
unto them; whether they be lectures of arts, or of professions For
it is necessary to the progression of sciences that readers be of
the most able and sufficient men; as those which are ordained for
generating and propagating of sciences, and not for transitory use.
This cannot be, except their condition and endowment be such as may
content the ablest man to appropriate his whole labor and continue
his whole age in that function and attendance; and therefore must
have a proportion answerable to that mediocrity or competency of
advancement, which may be expected from a profession or the
practice of a profession. So as, if you will have sciences
flourish, you must observe David's military law, which was, "That
those which staid with the carriage should have equal part with
those which were in the action"; else will the carriages be ill
attended. So readers in sciences are indeed the guardians of the
stores and provisions of sciences whence men in active courses are
furnished, and therefore ought to have equal entertainment with
them; otherwise if the fathers in sciences be of the weakest sort
or be ill maintained,</p>
<blockquote>"Et patrum invalidi referent jejunia
nati:"</blockquote>
<p>[Weakness of parents will show in feebleness of offspring.]</p>
<p>Another defect I note, wherein I shall need some alchemist to
help me, who call upon men to sell their books and to build
furnaces; quitting and forsaking Minerva and the Muses as barren
virgins, and relying upon Vulcan. But certain it is, that unto the
deep, fruitful, and operative study of many sciences, specially
natural philosophy and physic, books be not only the instrumentals;
wherein also the beneficence of men hath not been altogether
wanting. For we see spheres, globes, astrolabes, maps, and the
like, have been provided as appurtenances to astronomy and
cosmography, as well as books. We see likewise that some places
instituted for physic have annexed the commodity of gardens for
simples of all sorts, and do likewise command the use of dead
bodies for anatomies. But these do respect but a few things. In
general, there will hardly be any main proficience in the
disclosing of nature, except there be some allowance for expenses
about experiments; whether they be experiments appertaining to
Vulcanus or Daedalus, furnace or engine, or any other kind. And
therefore, as secretaries and spials of princes and states bring in
bills for intelligence, so you must allow the spials and
intelligencers of nature to bring in their bills; or else you shall
be ill advertised.</p>
<p>And if Alexander made such a liberal assignation to Aristotle of
treasure for the allowance of hunters, fowlers, fishers, and the
like, that he mought compile an history of nature, much better do
they deserve it that travail in arts of nature.</p>
<p>Another defect which I note, is an intermission or neglect in
those which are governors in universities of consultation, and in
princes or superior persons of visitation; to enter into account
and consideration, whether the readings, exercises, and other
customs appertaining unto learning, anciently begun and since
continued, be well instituted or no; and thereupon to ground an
amendment or reformation in that which shall be found inconvenient.
For it is one of your Majesty's own most wise and princely maxims,
"that in all usages and precedents, the times be considered wherein
they first began; which if they were weak or ignorant, it
derogateth from the authority of the usage, and leaveth it for
suspect." And therefore inasmuch as most of the usages and orders
of the universities were derived from more obscure times, it is the
more requisite they be re-examined. In this kind I will give an
instance or two, for example's sake, of things that are the most
obvious and familiar. The one is a matter, which, though it be
ancient and general, yet I hold to be an error; which is, that
scholars in universities come too soon and too unripe to logic and
rhetoric, arts fitter for graduates than children and novices. For
these two, rightly taken, are the gravest of sciences, being the
arts of arts; the one for judgment, the other for ornament. And
they be the rules and directions how to set forth and dispose
matter: and therefore for minds empty and unfraught with matter,
and which have not gathered that which Cicero calleth <i>sylva</i>
and <i>supellex</i>, stuff and variety, to begin with those arts
(as if one should learn to weigh or to measure or to paint the
wind) doth work but this effect, that the wisdom of those arts,
which is great and universal, is almost made contemptible, and is
degenerate into childish sophistry and ridiculous affectation. And
further, the untimely learning of them hath drawn on by consequence
the superficial and unprofitable teaching and writing of them, as
fitteth indeed to the capacity of children. Another is a lack I
find in the exercises used in the universities, which do make too
great a divorce between invention and memory. For their speeches
are either premeditate, in <i>verbis conceptis</i>, where nothing
is left to invention, or merely extemporal, where little is left to
memory; whereas in life and action there is least use of either of
these, but rather of intermixtures of premeditation and invention,
notes and memory. So as the exercise fitteth not the practice, nor
the image the life; and it is ever a true rule in exercises, that
they be framed as near as may be to the life of practice; for
otherwise they do pervert the motions and faculties of the mind,
and not prepare them. The truth whereof is not obscure, when
scholars come to the practices of professions, or other actions of
civil life; which when they set into, this want is soon found by
themselves, and sooner by others. But this part, touching the
amendment of the institutions and orders of universities, I will
conclude with the clause of Caesar's letter to Oppius and Balbus,
"Hoc quem admodum fieri possit, nonnulla mihi in mentem veniunt, et
multa reperiri possunt: de iis rebus rogo vos ut cogitationem
suscipiatis." [How this may be done, some ways come to my mind and
many may be devised; I ask you to take these things into
consideration.]</p>
<p>Another defect which I note ascendeth a little higher than the
precedent. For as the proficience of learning consisteth much in
the orders and institutions of universities in the same States and
kingdoms, so it would be yet more advanced, if there were more
intelligence mutual between the universities of Europe than now
there is. We see there be many orders and foundations, which though
they be divided under several sovereignties and territories, yet
they take themselves to have a kind of contract, fraternity, and
correspondence one with the other, insomuch as they have
Provincials and Generals. And surely as nature createth brotherhood
in families, and arts mechanical contract brotherhoods in
communalties, and the anointment of God superinduceth a brotherhood
in kings and bishops; so in like manner there cannot but be a
fraternity in learning and illumination, relating to that paternity
which is attributed to God, who is called the Father of
illuminations or lights.</p>
<p>The last defect which I will note is, that there hath not been,
or very rarely been, any public designation of writers or inquirers
concerning such parts of knowledge as may appear not to have been
already sufficiently labored or undertaken; unto which point it is
an inducement to enter into a view and examination what parts of
learning have been prosecuted, and what omitted. For the opinion of
plenty is amongst the causes of want, and the great quantity of
books maketh a show rather of superfluity than lack; which
surcharge nevertheless is not to be remedied by making no more
books, but by making more good books, which, as the serpent of
Moses, mought devour the serpents of the enchanters.</p>
<p>The removing of all the defects formerly enumerated, except the
last, and of the active part also of the last (which is the
designation of writers), are <i>opera basilica</i> [kings' works];
towards which the endeavors of a private man may be but as an image
in a cross-way, that may point at the way, but cannot go it. But
the inducing part of the latter (which is the survey of learning)
may be set forward by private travail. Wherefore I will now attempt
to make a general and faithful perambulation of learning, with an
inquiry what parts thereof lie fresh and waste, and not improved
and converted by the industry of man; to the end that such a plot
made and recorded to memory, may both minister light to any public
designation, and also serve to excite voluntary endeavors. Wherein
nevertheless my purpose is at this time to note only omissions and
deficiencies, and not to make any redargution of errors or
incomplete prosecutions. For it is one thing to set forth what
ground lieth unmanured, and another thing to correct ill husbandry
in that which is manured.</p>
<p>In the handling and undertaking of which work I am not ignorant
what it is that I do now move and attempt, nor insensible of mine
own weakness to sustain my purpose. But my hope is, that if my
extreme love to learning carry me too far, I may obtain the excuse
of affection; for that "it is not granted to man to love and to be
wise." But I know well I can use no other liberty of judgment than
I must leave to others; and I, for my part, shall be indifferently
glad either to perform myself, or accept from another, that duty of
humanity, "Nam qui erranti comiter monstrat viam," etc. [To kindly
show the wanderer the path.] I do foresee likewise that of those
things which I shall enter and register as deficiencies and
omissions, many will conceive and censure that some of them are
already done and extant; others to be but curiosities, and things
of no great use; and others to be of too great difficulty and
almost impossibility to be compassed and effected. But for the two
first, I refer myself to the particulars For the last, touching
impossibility, I take it those things are to be held possible which
may be done by some person, though not by every one; and which may
be done by many, though not by any one; and which may be done in
the succession of ages, though not within the hour-glass of one
man's life; and which may be done by public designation, though not
by private endeavor. But notwithstanding, if any man will take to
himself rather that of Solomon, "Dicit piger, Leo est in via" [the
sluggard says there is a lion in the path], than that of Virgil,
"Possunt quia posse videntur" [they can, because they think they
can], I shall be content that my labors be esteemed but as the
better sort of wishes, for as it asketh some knowledge to demand a
question not impertinent, so it requireth some sense to make a wish
not absurd.</p>

<h3>TO MY LORD TREASURER BURGHLEY</h3>
<center>From 'Letters and Life,' by James Spedding</center>
<p><i>My Lord:</i></p>
<p>With as much confidence as mine own honest and faithful devotion
unto your service and your honorable correspondence unto me and my
poor estate can breed in a man, do I commend myself unto your
Lordship. I wax now somewhat ancient; one and thirty years is a
great deal of sand in the hour-glass. My health, I thank God, I
find confirmed; and I do not fear that action shall impair it,
because I account my ordinary course of study and meditation to be
more painful than most parts of action are. I ever bare a mind (in
some middle place that I could discharge) to serve her Majesty; not
as a man born under Sol, that loveth honor; nor under Jupiter, that
loveth business (for the contemplative planet carrieth me away
wholly); but as a man born under an excellent Sovereign, that
deserveth the dedication of all men's abilities. Besides, I do not
find in myself so much self-love, but that the greater parts of my
thoughts are to deserve well (if I were able) of my friends, and
namely of your Lordship; who being the Atlas of this commonwealth,
the honor of my house, and the second founder of my poor estate, I
am tied by all duties, both of a good patriot and of an unworthy
kinsman, and of an obliged servant, to employ whatsoever I am to do
you service. Again, the meanness of my estate does somewhat move
me; for though I cannot excuse myself that I am either prodigal or
slothful, yet my health is not to spend, nor my course to get.
Lastly, I confess that I have as vast contemplative ends as I have
moderate civil ends: for I have taken all knowledge to be my
province; and if I could purge it of two sorts of rovers, whereof
the one with frivolous disputations, confutations, and verbosities,
the other with blind experiments and auricular traditions and
impostures, hath committed so many spoils, I hope I should bring in
industrious observations, grounded conclusions, and profitable
inventions and discoveries; the best state of that province. This,
whether it be curiosity, or vain glory, or nature, or (if one take
it favorably) <i>philanthropia</i>, is so fixed in my mind as it
cannot be removed. And I do easily see, that place of any
reasonable countenance doth bring commandment of more wits than of
a man's own; which is the thing I greatly affect. And for your
Lordship, perhaps you shall not find more strength and less
encounter in any other. And if your Lordship shall find now, or at
any time, that I do seek or affect any place whereunto any that is
nearer unto your Lordship shall be concurrent, say then that I am a
most dishonest man. And if your Lordship will not carry me on, I
will not do as Anaxagoras did, who reduced himself with
contemplation unto voluntary poverty: but this I will do; I will
sell the inheritance that I have, and purchase some lease of quick
revenue, or some office of gain that shall be executed by deputy,
and so give over all care of service, and become some sorry
book-maker, or a true pioneer in that mine of truth, which (he
said) lay so deep. This which I have writ unto your Lordship is
rather thoughts than words, being set down without all art,
disguising, or reservation. Wherein I have done honor both to your
Lordship's wisdom, in judging that that will be best believed of
your Lordship which is truest, and to your Lordship's good nature,
in retaining nothing from you. And even so I wish your Lordship all
happiness, and to myself means and occasion to be added to my
faithful desire to do you service. From my lodging at Gray's
Inn.</p>

<h3>IN PRAISE OF KNOWLEDGE</h3>
<center>From 'Letters and Life,' by James Spedding</center>
<p>Silence were the best celebration of that which I mean to
commend; for who would not use silence, where silence is not made,
and what crier can make silence in such a noise and tumult of vain
and popular opinions?</p>
<p>My praise shall be dedicated to the mind itself. The mind is the
man and the knowledge of the mind. A man is but what he knoweth.
The mind itself is but an accident to knowledge; for knowledge is a
double of that which is; the truth of being and the truth of
knowing is all one.</p>
<p>Are not the pleasures of the affections greater than the
pleasures of the senses? And are not the pleasures of the intellect
greater than the pleasures of the affections? Is not knowledge a
true and only natural pleasure, whereof there is no satiety? Is it
not knowledge that doth alone clear the mind of all perturbation?
How many things are there which we imagine not? How many things do
we esteem and value otherwise than they are! This ill-proportioned
estimation, these vain imaginations, these be the clouds of error
that turn into the storms of perturbation. Is there any such
happiness as for a man's mind to be raised above the confusion of
things, where he may have the prospect of the order of nature and
the error of men?</p>
<p>But is this a vein only of delight, and not of discovery? of
contentment, and not of benefit? Shall he not as well discern the
riches of nature's warehouse, as the benefit of her shop? Is truth
ever barren? Shall he not be able thereby to produce worthy
effects, and to endow the life of man with infinite
commodities?</p>
<p>But shall I make this garland to be put upon a wrong head? Would
anybody believe me, if I should verify this upon the knowledge that
is now in use? Are we the richer by one poor invention, by reason
of all the learning that hath been these many hundred years? The
industry of artificers maketh some small improvement of things
invented; and chance sometimes in experimenting maketh us to
stumble upon somewhat which is new; but all the disputation of the
learned never brought to light one effect of nature before unknown.
When things are known and found out, then they can descant upon
them, they can knit them into certain causes, they can reduce them
to their principles. If any instance of experience stand against
them, they can range it in order by some distinctions. But all this
is but a web of the wit, it can work nothing. I do not doubt but
that common notions, which we call reason, and the knitting of them
together, which we call logic, are the art of reason and studies.
But they rather cast obscurity than gain light to the contemplation
of nature. All the philosophy of nature which is now received, is
either the philosophy of the Grecians, or that other of the
Alchemists. That of the Grecians hath the foundations in words, in
ostentation, in confutation, in sects, in schools, in disputations.
The Grecians were (as one of themselves saith), "you Grecians, ever
children." They knew little antiquity; they knew (except fables)
not much above five hundred years before themselves; they knew but
a small portion of the world. That of the Alchemists hath the
foundation in imposture, in auricular traditions and obscurity; it
was catching hold of religion, but the principle of it is, "Populus
vult decipi." So that I know no great difference between these
great philosophies, but that the one is a loud-crying folly, and
the other is a whispering folly. The one is gathered out of a few
vulgar observations, and the other out of a few experiments of a
furnace. The one never faileth to multiply words, and the other
ever faileth to multiply gold. Who would not smile at Aristotle,
when he admireth the eternity and invariableness of the heavens, as
there were not the like in the bowels of the earth? Those be the
confines and borders of these two kingdoms, where the continual
alteration and incursion are. The superficies and upper parts of
the earth are full of varieties. The superficies and lower part of
the heavens (which we call the middle region of the air) is full of
variety. There is much spirit in the one part that cannot be
brought into mass. There is much massy body in the other place that
cannot be refined to spirit. The common air is as the waste ground
between the borders. Who would not smile at the astronomers? I mean
not these new carmen which drive the earth about, but the ancient
astronomers, which feign the moon to be the swiftest of all planets
in motion, and the rest in order, the higher the slower; and so are
compelled to imagine a double motion; whereas how evident is it,
that that which they call a contrary motion is but an abatement of
motion. The fixed stars overgo Saturn, and so in them and the rest
all is but one motion, and the nearer the earth the slower; a
motion also whereof air and water do participate, though much
interrupted.</p>
<p>But why do I in a conference of pleasure enter into these great
matters, in sort that pretending to know much, I should forget what
is seasonable? Pardon me, it was because all [other] things may be
endowed and adorned with speeches, but knowledge itself is more
beautiful than any apparel of words that can be put upon it.</p>
<p>And let not me seem arrogant, without respect to these great
reputed authors. Let me so give every man his due, as I give Time
his due, which is to discover truth. Many of these men had greater
wits, far above mine own, and so are many in the universities of
Europe at this day. But alas, they learn nothing there but to
believe: first to believe that others know that which they know
not; and after [that] themselves know that which they know not. But
indeed facility to believe, impatience to doubt, temerity to
answer, glory to know, doubt to contradict, end to gain, sloth to
search, seeking things in words, resting in part of nature; these,
and the like, have been the things which have forbidden the happy
match between the mind of man and the nature of things, and in
place thereof have married it to vain notions and blind
experiments. And what the posterity and issue of so honorable a
match may be, it is not hard to consider. Printing, a gross
invention; artillery, a thing that lay not far out of the way; the
needle, a thing partly known before; what a change have these three
made in the world in these times; the one in state of learning, the
other in state of the war, the third in the state of treasure,
commodities, and navigation. And those, I say, were but stumbled
upon and lighted upon by chance. Therefore, no doubt the
sovereignty of man lieth hid in knowledge; wherein many things are
reserved, which kings with their treasure cannot buy, nor with
their force command; their spials and intelligencers can give no
news of them, their seamen and discoverers cannot sail where they
grow. Now we govern nature in opinions, but we are thrall unto her
in necessity; but if we would be led by her in invention, we should
command her in action.</p>

<h3>TO THE LORD CHANCELLOR, TOUCHING THE HISTORY OF BRITAIN</h3>
<center>From 'Letters and Life,' by James Spedding</center>
<p><i>It may please your good Lordship:</i></p>
<p>Some late act of his Majesty, referred to some former speech
which I have heard from your Lordship, bred in me a great desire,
and by strength of desire a boldness to make an humble proposition
to your Lordship, such as in me can be no better than a wish: but
if your Lordship should apprehend it, may take some good and worthy
effect. The act I speak of, is the order given by his Majesty, as I
understand, for the erection of a tomb or monument for our late
sovereign Lady Queen Elizabeth: wherein I may note much, but this
at this time; that as her Majesty did always right to his
Highness's hopes, so his Majesty doth in all things right to her
memory; a very just and princely retribution. But from this
occasion, by a very easy ascent, I passed furder, being put in
mind, by this Representative of her person, of the more true and
more firm Representative, which is of her life and government. For
as Statuaes and Pictures are dumb histories, so histories are
speaking Pictures. Wherein if my affection be not too great, or my
reading too small, I am of this opinion, that if Plutarch were
alive to write lives by parallels, it would trouble him for virtue
and fortune both to find for her a parallel amongst women. And
though she was of the passive sex, yet her government was so
active, as, in my simple opinion, it made more impression upon the
several states of Europe, than it received from thence. But I
confess unto your Lordship I could not stay here, but went a little
furder into the consideration of the times which have passed since
King Henry the 8th; wherein I find the strangest variety that in
like number of successions of any hereditary monarchy hath ever
been known. The reign of a child; the offer of an usurpation
(though it were but as a Diary Ague); the reign of a lady married
to a foreign Prince; and the reign of a lady solitary and
unmarried. So that as it cometh to pass in massive bodies, that
they have certain trepidations and waverings before they fix and
settle; so it seemeth that by the providence of God this monarchy,
before it was to settle in his Majesty and his generations (in
which I hope it is now established for ever), it had these
prelusive changes in these barren princes. Neither could I contain
myself here (as it is easier to produce than to stay a wish), but
calling to remembrance the unworthiness of the history of England
(in the main continuance thereof), and the partiality and obliquity
of that of Scotland, in the latest and largest author that I have
seen: I conceived it would be honor for his Majesty, and a work
very memorable, if this island of Great Britain, as it is now
joined in Monarchy for the ages to come, so were joined in History
for the times past; and that one just and complete History were
compiled of both nations. And if any man think it may refresh the
memory of former discords, he may satisfy himself with the verse,
"olim haec meminisse juvabit:" for the case being now altered, it
is matter of comfort and gratulation to remember former
troubles.</p>
<p>Thus much, if it may please your Lordship, was in the optative
mood. It is true that I did look a little in the potential; wherein
the hope which I conceived was grounded upon three observations.
The first, of the times, which do flourish in learning, both of art
and language; which giveth hope not only that it may be done, but
that it may be well done. For when good things are undertaken in
ill times, it turneth but to loss; as in this very particular we
have a fresh example of Polydore Vergile, who being designed to
write the English History by K. Henry the 8th (a strange choice to
chuse a stranger), and for his better instruction having obtained
into his hands many registers and memorials out of the monasteries,
did indeed deface and suppress better things than those he did
collect and reduce. Secondly, I do see that which all the world
seeth in his Majesty, both a wonderful judgment in learning and a
singular affection towards learning, and the works of true honor
which are of the mind and not of the hand. For there cannot be the
like honor sought in the building of galleries, or the planting of
elms along highways, and the like manufactures, things rather of
magnificence than of magnanimity, as there is in the uniting of
states, pacifying of controversies, nourishing and augmenting of
learning and arts, and the particular actions appertaining unto
these; of which kind Cicero judged truly, when he said to Caesar,
"Quantum operibus tuis detrahet vetustas, tantum addet laudibus."
And lastly, I called to mind, that your Lordship at sometimes hath
been pleased to express unto me a great desire, that something of
this nature should be performed; answerably indeed to your other
noble and worthy courses and actions, wherein your Lordship sheweth
yourself not only an excellent Chancellor and Counselor, but also
an exceeding favorer and fosterer of all good learning and virtue,
both in men and matters, persons and actions: joining and adding
unto the great services towards his Majesty, which have, in small
compass of time, been accumulated upon your Lordship, many other
deservings both of the Church and Commonwealth and particulars; so
as the opinion of so great and wise a man doth seem unto me a good
warrant both of the possibility and worth of this matter. But all
this while I assure myself, I cannot be mistaken by your Lordship,
as if I sought an office or employment for myself. For no man
knoweth better than your Lordship, that (if there were in me any
faculty thereunto, as I am most unable), yet neither my fortune nor
profession would permit it. But because there be so many good
painters both for hand and colors, it needeth but encouragement and
instructions to give life and light unto it.</p>
<p>So in all humbleness I conclude my presenting to your good
Lordship this wish: that if it perish it is but a loss of that
which is not. And thus craving pardon that I have taken so much
time from your Lordship, I always remain</p>
<p class="loc">Your Lps. very humbly and much bounden</p>

<h3>TO VILLIERS ON HIS PATENT AS VISCOUNT</h3>
<center>From 'Letters and Life,' by James Spedding</center>
<p><i>Sir</i>:</p>
<p>I have sent you now your patent of creation of Lord Blechly of
Blechly, and of Viscount Villiers. Blechly is your own, and I like
the sound of the name better than Whaddon; but the name will be
hid, for you will be called Viscount Villiers. I have put them both
in a patent, after the manner of the patents of Earls where
baronies are joined; but the chief reason was, because I would
avoid double prefaces which had not been fit; nevertheless the
ceremony of robing and otherwise must be double.</p>
<p>And now, because I am in the country, I will send you some of my
country fruits; which with me are good meditations; which when I am
in the city are choked with business.</p>
<p>After that the King shall have watered your new dignities with
his bounty of the lands which he intends you, and that some other
things concerning your means which are now likewise in intention
shall be settled upon you; I do not see but you may think your
private fortunes established; and, therefore, it is now time that
you should refer your actions chiefly to the good of your sovereign
and your country. It is the life of an ox or beast always to eat,
and never to exercise; but men are born (and especially Christian
men), not to cram in their fortunes, but to exercise their virtues;
and yet the other hath been the unworthy, and (thanks be to God)
sometimes the unlucky humor of great persons in our times. Neither
will your further fortune be the further off: for assure yourself
that fortune is of a woman's nature, that will sooner follow you by
slighting than by too much wooing. And in this dedication of
yourself to the public, I recommend unto you principally that which
I think was never done since I was born; and which not done hath
bred almost a wilderness and solitude in the King's service; which
is, that you countenance, and encourage, and advance able men and
virtuous men, and meriting men in all kinds, degrees, and
professions. For in the time of the Cecils, the father and the son,
able men were by design and of purpose suppressed; and though of
late choice goeth better both in church and commonwealth, yet
money, and turn-serving, and cunning canvasses, and importunity
prevail too much. And in places of moment rather make able and
honest men yours, than advance those that are otherwise because
they are yours. As for cunning and corrupt men, you must (I know)
sometimes use them; but keep them at a distance; and let it appear
that you make use of them, rather than that they lead you. Above
all, depend wholly (next to God) upon the King; and be ruled (as
hitherto you have been) by his instructions; for that is best for
yourself. For the King's care and thoughts concerning you are
according to the thoughts of a great King; whereas your thoughts
concerning yourself are and ought to be according to the thoughts
of a modest man. But let me not weary you. The sum is that you
think goodness the best part of greatness; and that you remember
whence your rising comes, and make return accordingly.</p>
<p>God ever keep you.</p>

<h3>CHARGE TO JUSTICE HUTTON</h3>
<center>From 'Letters and Life,' by James Spedding</center>
<p><i>Mr. Serjeant Hutton</i>:</p>
<p>The King's most excellent Majesty, being duly informed of your
learning, integrity, discretion, experience, means, and reputation
in your country, hath thought fit not to leave you these talents to
be employed upon yourself only, but to call you to serve himself
and his people, in the place of one of his Justices of the court of
common pleas.</p>
<p>The court where you are to serve, is the local centre and heart
of the laws of this realm. Here the subject hath his assurance by
fines and recoveries. Here he hath his fixed and invariable
remedies by <i>praecipes</i> and writs of right. Here Justice opens
not by a by-gate of privilege, but by the great gate of the King's
original writs out of the Chancery. Here issues process of
outlawry; if men will not answer law in this centre of law, they
shall be cast out of the circle of law. And therefore it is proper
for you by all means with your wisdom and fortitude to maintain the
laws of the realm. Wherein, nevertheless, I would not have you
head-strong, but heart-strong; and to weigh and remember with
yourself, that the twelve Judges of the realm are as the twelve
lions under Solomon's throne; they must be lions, but yet lions,
under the throne; they must shew their stoutness in elevating and
bearing up the throne.</p>
<blockquote>To represent unto you the lines and portraitures of a
good judge:--The first is, That you should draw your learning out
of your books, not out of your brain.<br>
<br>
<p>2. That you should mix well the freedom of your own opinion with
the reverence of the opinion of your fellows.</p>
<br>
<p>3. That you should continue the studying of your books, and not
to spend on upon the old stock.</p>
<br>
<p>4. That you should fear no man's face, and yet not turn
stoutness into bravery.</p>
<br>
<p>5. That you should be truly impartial, and not so as men may see
affection through fine carriage.</p>
<br>
<p>6. That you be a light to jurors to open their eyes, but not a
guide to lead them by the noses.</p>
<br>
<p>7. That you affect not the opinion of pregnancy and expedition
by an impatient and catching hearing of the counselors at the
bar.</p>
<br>
<p>8. That your speech be with gravity, as one of the sages of the
law; and not talkative, nor with impertinent flying out to show
learning.</p>
<br>
<p>9. That your hands, and the hands of your hands (I mean those
about you), be clean, and uncorrupt from gifts, from meddling in
titles, and from serving of turns, be they of great ones or small
ones.</p>
<br>
<p>10. That you contain the jurisdiction of the court within the
ancient merestones, without removing the mark.</p>
<br>
<p>11. Lastly, That you carry such a hand over your ministers and
clerks, as that they may rather be in awe of you, than presume upon
you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These and the like points of the duty of a Judge, I forbear to
enlarge; for the longer I have lived with you, the shorter shall my
speech be to you; knowing that you come so furnished and prepared
with these good virtues, as whatsoever I shall say cannot be new
unto you. And therefore I will say no more unto you at this time,
but deliver you your patent.</p>

<center>From 'Letters and Life,' by James Spedding</center>
<p>Most gracious Lord God, my merciful Father, from my youth up, my
Creator, my Redeemer, my Comforter. Thou (O Lord) soundest and
searchest the depths and secrets of all hearts; thou knowledgest
the upright of heart, thou judgest the hypocrite, thou ponderest
men's thoughts and doings as in a balance, thou measurest their
intentions as with a line, vanity and crooked ways cannot be hid
from thee.</p>
<p>Remember (O Lord) how thy servant hath walked before thee:
remember what I have first sought, and what hath been principal in
mine intentions. I have loved thy assemblies, I have mourned for
the divisions of thy Church, I have delighted in the brightness of
thy sanctuary. This vine which thy right hand hath planted in this
nation, I have ever prayed unto thee that it might have the first
and the latter rain; and that it might stretch her branches to the
seas and to the floods. The state and bread of the poor and
oppressed have been precious in mine eyes: I have hated all cruelty
and hardness of heart: I have (though in a despised weed) procured
the good of all men. If any have been mine enemies, I thought not
of them; neither hath the sun almost set upon my displeasure; but I
have been as a dove, free from superfluity of maliciousness. Thy
creatures have been my books, but thy Scriptures much more. I have
sought thee in the courts, fields, and gardens, but I have found
thee in thy temples.</p>
<p>Thousands have been my sins, and ten thousand my transgressions;
but thy sanctifications have remained with me, and my heart,
through thy grace, hath been an unquenched coal upon thy altar. O
Lord, my strength, I have since my youth met with thee in all my
ways, by thy fatherly compassions, by thy comfortable
chastisements, and by thy most visible providence. As thy favors
have increased upon me, so have thy corrections; so as thou hast
been alway near me, O Lord; and ever as my worldly blessings were
exalted, so secret darts from thee have pierced me; and when I have
ascended before men, I have descended in humiliation before
thee.</p>
<p>And now when I thought most of peace and honor, thy hand is
heavy upon me, and hath humbled me, according to thy former
loving-kindness, keeping me still in thy fatherly school, not as a
bastard, but as a child. Just are thy judgments upon me for my
sins, which are more in number than the sands of the sea, but have
no proportion to thy mercies; for what are the sands of the sea, to
the sea, earth, heavens? and all these are nothing to thy
mercies.</p>
<p>Besides my innumerable sins, I confess before thee, that I am
debtor to thee for the gracious talent of thy gifts and graces
which I have neither put into a napkin, nor put it (as I ought) to
exchangers, where it might have made best profit; but mis-spent it
in things for which I was least fit; so as I may truly say, my soul
hath been a stranger in the course of my pilgrimage. Be merciful
into me (O Lord) for my Saviour's sake, and receive me unto thy
bosom, or guide me in thy ways.</p>

<h3>FROM THE 'APOPHTHEGMS'</h3>
<p>My Lo. of Essex, at the succor of Rhoan, made twenty-four
knights, which at that time was a great matter. Divers (7.) of
those gentlemen were of weak and small means; which when Queen
Elizabeth heard, she said, "My Lo. mought have done well to have
built his alms-house before he made his knights."</p>
<p>21. Many men, especially such as affect gravity, have a manner
after other men's speech to shake their heads. Sir Lionel Cranfield
would say, "That it was as men shake a bottle, to see if there was
any wit in their head or no."</p>
<p>33. Bias was sailing, and there fell out a great tempest, and
the mariners, that were wicked and dissolute fellows, called upon
the gods; but Bias said to them, "Peace, let them not know ye are
here."</p>
<p>42. There was a Bishop that was somewhat a delicate person, and
bathed twice a day. A friend of his said to him, "My lord, why do
you bathe twice a day?" The Bishop answered, "Because I cannot
conveniently bathe thrice."</p>
<p>55. Queen Elizabeth was wont to say of her instructions to great
officers, "That they were like to garments, strait at the first
putting on, but did by and by wear loose enough."</p>
<p>64. Sir Henry Wotton used to say, "That critics are like
brushers of noblemen's clothes."</p>
<p>66. Mr. Savill was asked by my lord of Essex his opinion
touching poets; who answered my lord, "He thought them the best
writers, next to those that write prose."</p>
<p>85. One was saying, "That his great-grandfather and grandfather
and father died at sea." Said another that heard him, "And I were
as you, I would never come at sea." "Why, (saith he) where did your
great-grandfather and grandfather and father die?" He answered,
"Where but in their beds." Saith the other, "And I were as you, I
would never come in bed."</p>
<p>97. Alonso of Arragon was wont to say, in commendation of age,
That age appeared to be best in four things: "Old wood best to
burn; old wine to drink; old friends to trust; and old authors to
read."</p>
<p>119. One of the fathers saith, "That there is but this
difference between the death of old men and young men: that old men
go to death, and death comes to young men."</p>

<h2><b>WALTER <a name="BAGEHOT"></a>BAGEHOT</b></h2>
<h3>(1826-1877)</h3>
<h3>BY FORREST MORGAN</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-w.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>alter Bagehot was born February 3d, 1826, at Langport,
Somersetshire, England; and died there March 24th, 1877. He sprang
on both sides from, and was reared in, a nest of wealthy bankers
and ardent Liberals, steeped in political history and with London
country houses where leaders of thought and politics resorted; and
his mother's brother-in-law was Dr. Prichard the ethnologist. This
heredity, progressive by disposition and conservative by trade, and
this entourage, produced naturally enough a mind at once rapid of
insight and cautious of judgment, devoted almost equally to
business action and intellectual speculation, and on its
speculative side turned toward the fields of political history and
sociology.</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/image256.png" width="40%" alt=
""><br>
<b>WALTER BAGEHOT</b></p>
<p>But there were equally important elements not traceable. His
freshness of mental vision, the strikingly novel points of view
from which he looked at every subject, was marvelous even in a
century so fertile of varied independences: he complained that "the
most galling of yokes is the tyranny of your next-door neighbor,"
the obligation of thinking as he thinks. He had a keen, almost
reckless wit and delicious buoyant humor, whose utterances never
pall by repetition; few authors so abound in tenaciously quotable
phrases and passages of humorous intellectuality. What is rarely
found in connection with much humor, he had a sensitive dreaminess
of nature, strongly poetic in feeling, whence resulted a large
appreciation of the subtler classes of poetry; of which he was an
acute and sympathizing critic. As part of this temperament, he had
a strong bent toward mysticism,--in one essay he says flatly that
"mysticism is true,"--which gave him a rare insight into the
religious nature and some obscure problems of religious history;
though he was too cool, scientific, and humorous to be a great
theologian.</p>
<p>Above all, he had that instinct of selective art, in felicity of
words and salience of ideas, which elevates writing into
literature; which long after a thought has merged its being and use
in those of wider scope, keeps it in separate remembrance and
retains for its creator his due of credit through the artistic
charm of the shape he gave it.</p>
<p>The result of a mixture of traits popularly thought
incompatible, and usually so in reality,--a great relish for the
driest business facts and a creative literary gift,--was absolutely
unique. Bagehot explains the general sterility of literature as a
guide to life by the fact that "so few people who can write know
anything;" and began a reform in his own person, by applying all
his highest faculties--the best not only of his thought but of his
imagination and his literary skill--to the theme of his daily work,
banking and business affairs and political economy. There have been
many men of letters who were excellent business men and hard
bargainers, sometimes indeed merchants or bankers, but they have
held their literature as far as possible off the plane of their
bread-winning; they have not used it to explain and decorate the
latter and made that the motive of art. Bagehot loved business not
alone as the born trader loves it, for its profit and its
gratification of innate likings,--"business is really pleasanter
than pleasure, though it does not look so," he says in
substance,--but as an artist loves a picturesque situation or a
journalist a murder; it pleased his literary sense as material for
analysis and composition. He had in a high degree that union of the
practical and the musing faculties which in its (as yet) highest
degree made Shakespeare; but even Shakespeare did not write dramas
on how to make theatres pay, or sonnets on real-estate
speculation.</p>
<p>Bagehot's career was determined, as usual, partly by character
and partly by circumstances. He graduated at London University in
1848, and studied for and was called to the bar; but his father
owned an interest in a rich old provincial bank and a good
shipping-business, and instead of the law he joined in their
conduct. He had just before, however, passed a few months in
France, including the time of Louis Napoleon's <i>coup
d'&eacute;tat</i> in December, 1851; and from Paris he wrote to the
London Inquirer (a Unitarian weekly) a remarkable series of letters
on that event and its immediate sequents, defending the usurpation
vigorously and outlining his political creed, from whose main lines
he swerved but little in after life. Waiving the question whether
the defense was valid,--and like all first-rate minds, Bagehot is
even more instructive when he is wrong than when he is right,
because the wrong is sure to be almost right and the truth on its
side neglected,--the letters are full of fresh, acute, and even
profound ideas, sharp exposition of those primary objects of
government which demagogues and buncombe legislators ignore, racy
wit, sarcasm, and description (in one passage he rises for a moment
into really blood-stirring rhetoric), and proofs of his capacity
thus early for reducing the confused cross-currents of daily life
to the operation of great embracing laws. No other writing of a
youth of twenty-five on such subjects--or almost none--is worth
remembering at all for its matter; while this is perennially
wholesome and educative, as well as capital reading.</p>
<p>From this on he devoted most of his spare time to literature:
that he found so much spare time, and produced so much of a high
grade while winning respect as a business manager, proves the
excellent quality of his business brain. He was one of the editors
of the National Review, a very able and readable English quarterly,
from its foundation in 1854 to its death in 1863, and wrote for it
twenty literary, biographical, and theological papers, which are
among his best titles to enduring remembrance, and are full of his
choicest flavors, his wealth of thought, fun, poetic sensitiveness,
and deep religious feeling of the needs of human nature. Previous
to this, he had written some good articles for the Prospective
Review, and he wrote some afterwards for the Fortnightly Review
(including the series afterwards gathered into 'Physics and
Politics'), and other periodicals.</p>
<p>But his chief industry and most peculiar work was determined by
his marriage in 1858 to the daughter of James Wilson, an
ex-merchant who had founded the Economist as a journal of trade,
banking, and investment, and made it prosperous and rather
influential. Mr. Wilson was engaging in politics, where he rose to
high office and would probably have ended in the Cabinet; but being
sent to India to regulate its finances, died there in 1860. Bagehot
thereupon took control of the paper, and <i>was</i> the paper until
his death in 1877; and the position he gave it was as unique as his
own. On banking, finance, taxation, and political economy in
general his utterances had such weight that Chancellors of the
Exchequer consulted him as to the revenues, and the London business
world eagerly studied the paper for guidance. But he went far
beyond this, and made it an unexampled force in politics and
governmental science, personal to himself. For the first time a
great political thinker applied his mind week by week to discussing
the problems presented by passing politics, and expounding the
drift and meaning of current events in his nation and the others
which bore closest on it, as France and America. That he gained
such a hearing was due not alone to his immense ability, and to a
style carefully modeled on the conversation of business men with
each other, but to his cool moderation and evident aloofness from
party as party. He dissected each like a man of science: party was
to him a tool and not a religion. He gibed at the Tories; but the
Tories forgave him because he was half a Tory at heart,--he utterly
distrusted popular instincts and was afraid of popular ignorance.
He was rarely warm for the actual measures of the Liberals; but the
Liberals knew that he intensely despised the pig-headed
obstructiveness of the typical Tory, and had no kinship with the
blind worshipers of the <i>status quo</i>. To natives and
foreigners alike for many years the paper was single and
invaluable: in it one could find set forth acutely and
dispassionately the broad facts and the real purport of all great
legislative proposals, free from the rant and mendacity, the fury
and distortion, the prejudice and counter-prejudice of the party
press.</p>
<p>An outgrowth of his treble position as banker, economic writer,
and general litt&eacute;rateur, was his charming book 'Lombard
Street.' Most writers know nothing about business, he sets forth,
most business men cannot write, therefore most writing about
business is either unreadable or untrue: he put all his literary
gifts at its service, and produced a book as instructive as a trade
manual and more delightful than most novels. Its luminous, easy,
half-playful "business talk" is irresistibly captivating. It is a
description and analysis of the London money market and its
component parts,--the Bank of England, the joint-stock banks, the
private banks, and the bill-brokers. It will live, however, as
literature and as a picture, not as a banker's guide; as the
vividest outline of business London, of the "great commerce" and
the fabric of credit which is the basis of modern civilization and
of which London is the centre, that the world has ever known.</p>
<p>Previous to this, the most widely known of his works--'The
English Constitution,' much used as a text-book--had made a new
epoch in political analysis, and placed him among the foremost
thinkers and writers of his time. Not only did it revolutionize the
accepted mode of viewing that governmental structure, but as a
treatise on government in general its novel types of classification
are now admitted commonplaces. Besides its main themes, the book is
a great store of thought and suggestion on government, society, and
human nature,--for as in all his works, he pours on his nominal
subject a flood of illumination and analogy from the unlikeliest
sources; and a piece of eminently pleasurable reading from end to
end. Its basic novelty lay in what seems the most natural of
inquiries, but which in fact was left for Bagehot's original mind
even to think of,--the actual working of the governmental system in
practice, as distinguished from legal theory. The result of this
novel analysis was startling: old powers and checks went to the
rubbish heap, and a wholly new set of machinery and even new
springs of force and life were substituted. He argued that the
actual use of the English monarchy is not to do the work of
government, but through its roots in the past to gain popular
loyalty and support for the real government, which the masses would
not obey if they realized its genuine nature; that "it raises the
army though it does not win the battle." He showed that the
function of the House of Peers is not as a co-ordinate power with
the Commons (which is the real government), but as a revising body
and an index of the strength of popular feeling. Constitutional
governments he divides into Cabinet, where the people can change
the government at any time, and therefore follow its acts and
debates eagerly and instructedly; and Presidential, where they can
only change it at fixed terms, and are therefore apathetic and
ill-informed and care little for speeches which can effect
nothing.</p>
<p>Just before 'Lombard Street' came his scientific masterpiece,
'Physics and Politics'; a work which does for human society what
the 'Origin of Species' does for organic life, expounding its
method of progress from very low if not the lowest forms to higher
ones. Indeed, one of its main lines is only a special application
of Darwin's "natural selection" to societies, noting the survival
of the strongest (which implies in the long run the best developed
in all virtues that make for social cohesion) through conflict; but
the book is so much more than that, in spite of its heavy debt to
all scientific and institutional research, that it remains a
first-rate feat of original constructive thought. It is the more
striking from its almost ludicrous brevity compared with the
novelty, variety, and pregnancy of its ideas. It is scarcely more
than a pamphlet; one can read it through in an evening: yet there
is hardly any book which is a master-key to so many historical
locks, so useful a standard for referring scattered sociological
facts to, so clarifying to the mind in the study of early history.
The work is strewn with fertile and suggestive observations from
many branches of knowledge. Its leading idea of the needs and
difficulties of early societies is given in one of the
citations.</p>
<p>The unfinished 'Economic Studies' are partially a re-survey of
the same ground on a more limited scale, and contain in addition a
mass of the nicest and shrewdest observations on modern trade and
society, full of truth and suggestiveness. All the other books
printed under his name are collections either from the Economist or
from outside publications.</p>
<p>As a thinker, Bagehot's leading positions may be roughly
summarized thus: in history, that reasoning from the present to the
past is generally wrong and frequently nonsense; in politics, that
abstract systems are foolish, that a government which does not
benefit its subjects has no rights against one that will, that the
masses had much better let the upper ranks do the governing than
meddle with it themselves, that all classes are too eager to act
without thinking and ought not to attempt so much; in society, that
democracy is an evil because it leaves no specially trained upper
class to furnish models for refinement. But there is vastly more
besides this, and his value lies much more in the mental
clarification afforded by his details than in the new principles of
action afforded by his generalizations. He leaves men saner,
soberer, juster, with a clearer sense of perspective, of real
issues, that more than makes up for a slight diminution of
zeal.</p>
<p>As pure literature, the most individual trait in his writings
sprang from his scorn of mere word-mongering divorced from actual
life. "A man ought to have the right of being a Philistine if he
chooses," he tells us: "there is a sickly incompleteness in men too
fine for the world and too nice to work their way through it." A
great man of letters, no one has ever mocked his craft so
persistently. A great thinker, he never tired of humorously
magnifying the active and belittling the intellectual temperament.
Of course it was only half-serious: he admits the force and utility
of colossal visionaries like Shelley, constructive scholars like
Gibbon, ascetic artists like Milton, even light dreamers like
Hartley Coleridge; indeed, intellectually he appreciates all
intellectual force, and scorns feeble thought which has the
effrontery to show itself, and those who are "cross with the agony
of a new idea." But his heart goes out to the unscholarly Cavalier
with his dash and his loyalty, to the county member who "hardly
reads two books per existence," and even to the rustic who sticks
to his old ideas and whom "it takes seven weeks to comprehend an
atom of a new one." A petty surface consistency must not be exacted
from the miscellaneous utterances of a humorist: all sorts of
complementary half-truths are part of his service. His own quite
just conception of humor, as meaning merely full vision and
balanced judgment, is his best defense: "when a man has attained
the deep conception that there is such a thing as nonsense," he
says, "you may be sure of him for ever after." At bottom he is
thoroughly consistent: holding that the masses should work in
contented deference to their intellectual guides, but those guides
should qualify themselves by practical experience of life, that
poetry is not an amusement for lazy sybarites but the most
elevating of spiritual influences, that religions cut the roots of
their power by trying to avoid supernaturalism and cultivate
intelligibility, and that the animal basis of human life is a
screen expressly devised to shut off direct knowledge of God and
make character possible.</p>
<p>To make his acquaintance first is to enter upon a store of high
and fine enjoyment, and of strong and vivifying thought, which one
must be either very rich of attainment or very feeble of grasp to
find unprofitable or pleasureless.</p>

<h3>THE VIRTUES OF STUPIDITY</h3>
<center>From 'Letters on the French Coup d'&Eacute;tat'</center>
<p>I fear you will laugh when I tell you what I conceive to be
about the most essential mental quality for a free people whose
liberty is to be progressive, permanent, and on a large scale: it
is much stupidity. Not to begin by wounding any present
susceptibilities, let me take the Roman character; for with one
great exception,--I need not say to whom I allude,--they are the
great political people of history. Now, is not a certain dullness
their most visible characteristic? What is the history of their
speculative mind? a blank; what their literature? a copy. They have
left not a single discovery in any abstract science, not a single
perfect or well-formed work of high imagination. The Greeks, the
perfection of human and accomplished genius, bequeathed to mankind
the ideal forms of self-idolizing art, the Romans imitated and
admired; the Greeks explained the laws of nature, the Romans
wondered and despised; the Greeks invented a system of numerals
second only to that now in use, the Romans counted to the end of
their days with the clumsy apparatus which we still call by their
name; the Greeks made a capital and scientific calendar, the Romans
began their month when the Pontifex Maximus happened to spy out the
new moon. Throughout Latin literature, this is the perpetual
puzzle:--Why are we free and they slaves, we praetors and they
barbers? why do the stupid people always win and the clever people
always lose? I need not say that in real sound stupidity the
English are unrivaled: you'll hear more wit and better wit in an
Irish street row than would keep Westminster Hall in humor for five
weeks.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>In fact, what we opprobriously call "stupidity," though not an
enlivening quality in common society, is nature's favorite resource
for preserving steadiness of conduct and consistency of opinion; it
enforces concentration: people who learn slowly, learn only what
they must. The best security for people's doing their duty is, that
they should not know anything else to do; the best security for
fixedness of opinion is, that people should be incapable of
comprehending what is to be said on the other side. These valuable
truths are no discoveries of mine: they are familiar enough to
people whose business it is to know them. Hear what a douce and
aged attorney says of your peculiarly promising barrister:--"Sharp?
Oh, yes! he's too sharp by half. He is not <i>safe</i>, not a
minute, isn't that young man." I extend this, and advisedly
maintain that nations, just as individuals, may be too clever to be
practical and not dull enough to be free....</p>
<p>And what I call a proper stupidity keeps a man from all the
defects of this character: it chains the gifted possessor mainly to
his old ideas, it takes him seven weeks to comprehend an atom of a
new one; it keeps him from being led away by new theories, for
there is nothing which bores him so much; it restrains him within
his old pursuits, his well-known habits, his tried expedients, his
verified conclusions, his traditional beliefs. He is not tempted to
levity or impatience, for he does not see the joke and is
thick-skinned to present evils. Inconsistency puts him out: "What I
says is this here, as I was a-saying yesterday," is his notion of
historical eloquence and habitual discretion. He is very slow
indeed to be excited,--his passions, his feelings, and his
affections are dull and tardy strong things, falling in a certain
known direction, fixed on certain known objects, and for the most
part acting in a moderate degree and at a sluggish pace. You always
know where to find his mind. Now, this is exactly what (in politics
at least) you do not know about a Frenchman.</p>

<h3>REVIEW WRITING</h3>
<center>From 'The First Edinburgh Reviewers'</center>
<p>Review writing exemplifies the casual character of modern
literature: everything about it is temporary and fragmentary. Look
at a railway stall: you see books of every color,--blue, yellow,
crimson, "ring-streaked, speckled, and spotted,"--on every subject,
in every style, of every opinion, with every conceivable
difference, celestial or sublunary, maleficent, beneficent--but all
small. People take their literature in morsels, as they take
sandwiches on a journey....</p>
<p>And the change in appearance of books has been accompanied--has
been caused--by a similar change in readers. What a transition from
the student of former ages! from a grave man with grave cheeks and
a considerate eye, who spends his life in study, has no interest in
the outward world, hears nothing of its din and cares nothing for
its honors, who would gladly learn and gladly teach, whose whole
soul is taken up with a few books of 'Aristotle and his
Philosophy,'--to the merchant in the railway, with a head full of
sums, an idea that tallow is "up," a conviction that teas are
"lively," and a mind reverting perpetually from the little volume
which he reads to these mundane topics, to the railway, to the
shares, to the buying and bargaining universe. We must not wonder
that the outside of books is so different, when the inner nature of
those for whom they are written is so changed.</p>
<p>In this transition from ancient writing to modern, the
review-like essay and the essay-like review fill a large space.
Their small bulk, their slight pretension to systematic
completeness,--their avowal, it might be said, of necessary
incompleteness,--the facility of changing the subject, of selecting
points to attack, of exposing only the best corner for defense, are
great temptations. Still greater is the advantage of "our limits."
A real reviewer always spends his first and best pages on the parts
of a subject on which he wishes to write, the easy comfortable
parts which he knows. The formidable difficulties which he
acknowledges, you foresee by a strange fatality that he will only
reach two pages before the end; to his great grief, there is no
opportunity for discussing them. As a young gentleman at the India
House examination wrote "Time up" on nine unfinished papers in
succession, so you may occasionally read a whole review, in every
article of which the principal difficulty of each successive
question is about to be reached at the conclusion. Nor can any one
deny that this is the suitable skill, the judicious custom of the
craft.</p>

<h3>LORD ELDON</h3>
<center>From 'The First Edinburgh Reviewers'</center>
<p>As for Lord Eldon, it is the most difficult thing in the world
to believe that there ever was such a man; it only shows how
intense historical evidence is, that no one really doubts it. He
believed in everything which it is impossible to believe in,--in
the danger of Parliamentary Reform, the danger of Catholic
Emancipation, the danger of altering the Court of Chancery, the
danger of altering the courts of law, the danger of abolishing
capital punishment for trivial thefts, the danger of making
land-owners pay their debts, the danger of making anything more,
the danger of making anything less. It seems as if he maturely
thought, "Now, I know the present state of things to be consistent
with the existence of John Lord Eldon; but if we begin altering
that state, I am sure I do not know that it will be consistent." As
Sir Robert Walpole was against all committees of inquiry on the
simple ground, "If they once begin that sort of thing, who knows
who will be safe?" so that great Chancellor (still remembered in
his own scene) looked pleasantly down from the woolsack, and seemed
to observe, "Well, it <i>is</i> a queer thing that I should be
here, and here I mean to stay."</p>
<br>
<a name="BAGEHOT_4"></a>
<h3>TASTE</h3>
<center>From 'Wordsworth, Tennyson, and Browning'</center>
<p>There is a most formidable and estimable <i>insane</i> taste.
The will has great though indirect power over the taste, just as it
has over the belief. There are some horrid beliefs from which human
nature revolts, from which at first it shrinks, to which at first
no effort can force it. But if we fix the mind upon them, they have
a power over us, just because of their natural offensiveness. They
are like the sight of human blood. Experienced soldiers tell us
that at first, men are sickened by the smell and newness of blood,
almost to death and fainting; but that as soon as they harden their
hearts and stiffen their minds, as soon as they <i>will</i> bear
it, then comes an appetite for slaughter, a tendency to gloat on
carnage, to love blood (at least for the moment) with a deep, eager
love. It is a principle that if we put down a healthy instinctive
aversion, nature avenges herself by creating an unhealthy insane
attraction. For this reason, the most earnest truth-seeking men
fall into the worst delusions. They will not let their mind alone;
they force it toward some ugly thing, which a crotchet of argument,
a conceit of intellect recommends: and nature punishes their
disregard of her warning by subjection to the ugly one, by belief
in it. Just so, the most industrious critics get the most
admiration. They think it unjust to rest in their instinctive
natural horror; they overcome it, and angry nature gives them over
to ugly poems and marries them to detestable stanzas.</p>
<br>
<a name="BAGEHOT_5"></a>
<h3>CAUSES OF THE STERILITY OF LITERATURE</h3>
<center>From 'Shakespeare, the Man,' etc.</center>
<p>The reason why so few good books are written is, that so few
people that can write know anything. In general, an author has
always lived in a room, has read books, has cultivated science, is
acquainted with the style and sentiments of the best authors, but
he is out of the way of employing his own eyes and ears. He has
nothing to hear and nothing to see. His life is a vacuum. The
mental habits of Robert Southey, which about a year ago were so
extensively praised in the public journals, are the type of
literary existence, just as the praise bestowed on them shows the
admiration excited by them among literary people. He wrote poetry
(as if anybody could) before breakfast; he read during breakfast.
He wrote history until dinner; he corrected proof-sheets between
dinner and tea; he wrote an essay for the Quarterly afterwards; and
after supper, by way of relaxation, composed 'The Doctor'--a
lengthy and elaborate jest. Now, what can any one think of such a
life?--except how clearly it shows that the habits best fitted for
communicating information, formed with the best care, and daily
regulated by the best motives, are exactly the habits which are
likely to afford a man the least information to communicate.
Southey had no events, no experiences. His wife kept house and
allowed him pocket-money, just as if he had been a German professor
devoted to accents, tobacco, and the dates of Horace's
amours....</p>
<p>The critic in the 'Vicar of Wakefield' lays down that you should
<i>always</i> say that the picture would have been better if the
painter had taken more pains; but in the case of the practiced
literary man, you should often enough say that the writings would
have been much better if the writer had taken less pains. He says
he has devoted his life to the subject; the reply is, "Then you
have taken the best way to prevent your making anything of it.
Instead of reading studiously what Burgersdicius and Aenesidemus
said men were, you should have gone out yourself and seen (if you
can see) what they are." But there is a whole class of minds which
prefer the literary delineation of objects to the actual eyesight
of them. Such a man would naturally think literature more
instructive than life. Hazlitt said of Mackintosh, "He might like
to read an <i>account</i> of India; but India itself, with its
burning, shining face, would be a mere blank, an endless waste to
him. Persons of this class have no more to say to a matter of fact
staring them in the face, without a label in its mouth, than they
would to a hippopotamus."...</p>
<p>After all, the original way of writing books may turn out to be
the best. The first author, it is plain, could not have taken
anything from books, since there were no books for him to copy
from; he looked at things for himself. Anyhow the modern system
fails, for where are the amusing books from voracious students and
habitual writers?</p>
<p>Moreover, in general, it will perhaps be found that persons
devoted to mere literature commonly become devoted to mere
idleness. They wish to produce a great work, but they find they
cannot. Having relinquished everything to devote themselves to
this, they conclude on trial that this is impossible; they wish to
write, but nothing occurs to them: therefore they write nothing and
they do nothing. As has been said, they have nothing to do; their
life has no events, unless they are very poor; with any decent
means of subsistence, they have nothing to rouse them from an
indolent and musing dream. A merchant must meet his bills, or he is
civilly dead and uncivilly remembered; but a student may know
nothing of time, and be too lazy to wind lip his watch.</p>

<h3>THE SEARCH FOR HAPPINESS</h3>
<center>From 'William Cowper'</center>
<p>If there be any truly painful fact about the world now tolerably
well established by ample experience and ample records, it is that
an intellectual and indolent happiness is wholly denied to the
children of men. That most valuable author, Lucretius, who has
supplied us and others with an almost inexhaustible supply of
metaphors on this topic, ever dwells on the life of his gods with a
sad and melancholy feeling that no such life was possible on a
crude and cumbersome earth. In general, the two opposing agencies
are marriage and lack of money; either of these breaks the lot of
literary and refined inaction at once and forever. The first of
these, as we have seen, Cowper had escaped; his reserved and
negligent reveries were still free, at least from the invasion of
affection. To this invasion, indeed, there is commonly requisite
the acquiescence or connivance of mortality; but all men are
born--not free and equal, as the Americans maintain, but, in the
Old World at least--basely subjected to the yoke of coin. It is in
vain that in this hemisphere we endeavor after impecuniary fancies.
In bold and eager youth we go out on our travels: we visit Baalbec
and Paphos and Tadmor and Cythera,--ancient shrines and ancient
empires, seats of eager love or gentle inspiration; we wander far
and long; we have nothing to do with our fellow-men,--what are we,
indeed, to diggers and counters? we wander far, we dream to wander
forever--but we dream in vain. A surer force than the subtlest
fascination of fancy is in operation; the purse-strings tie us to
our kind. Our travel coin runs low, and we must return, away from
Tadmor and Baalbec, back to our steady, tedious industry and dull
work, to "la vieille Europe" (as Napoleon said), "qui m'ennuie." It
is the same in thought: in vain we seclude ourselves in elegant
chambers, in fascinating fancies, in refined reflections.</p>

<h3>ON EARLY READING</h3>
<center>From 'Edward Gibbon'</center>
<p>In school work Gibbon had uncommon difficulties and unusual
deficiencies; but these were much more than counterbalanced by a
habit which often accompanies a sickly childhood, and is the
commencement of a studious life,--the habit of desultory reading.
The instructiveness of this is sometimes not comprehended. S.T.
Coleridge used to say that he felt a great superiority over those
who had not read--and fondly read--fairy tales in their childhood:
he thought they wanted a sense which he possessed, the perception,
or apperception--we do not know which he used to say it was--of the
unity and wholeness of the universe. As to fairy tales, this is a
hard saying; but as to desultory reading, it is certainly true.
Some people have known a time in life when there was no book they
could not read. The fact of its being a book went immensely in its
favor. In early life there is an opinion that the obvious thing to
do with a horse is to ride it; with a cake, to eat it; with
sixpence, to spend it. A few boys carry this further, and think the
natural thing to do with a book is to read it. There is an argument
from design in the subject: if the book was not meant for that
purpose, for what purpose was it meant? Of course, of any
understanding of the works so perused there is no question or idea.
There is a legend of Bentham, in his earliest childhood, climbing
to the height of a huge stool, and sitting there evening after
evening, with two candles, engaged in the perusal of Rapin's
history; it might as well have been any other book. The doctrine of
utility had not then dawned on its immortal teacher; <i>cui
bono</i> was an idea unknown to him. He would have been ready to
read about Egypt, about Spain, about coals in Borneo, the teak-wood
in India, the current in the River Mississippi, on natural history
or human history, on theology or morals, on the state of the Dark
Ages or the state of the Light Ages, on Augustulus or Lord Chatham,
on the first century or the seventeenth, on the moon, the
millennium, or the whole duty of man. Just then, reading is an end
in itself. At that time of life you no more think of a future
consequence--of the remote, the very remote possibility of deriving
knowledge from the perusal of a book, than you expect so great a
result from spinning a peg-top. You spin the top, and you read the
book; and these scenes of life are exhausted. In such studies, of
all prose, perhaps the best is history: one page is so like
another, battle No. 1 is so much on a par with battle No. 2. Truth
may be, as they say, stranger than fiction, abstractedly; but in
actual books, novels are certainly odder and more astounding than
correct history.</p>
<p>It will be said, What is the use of this? why not leave the
reading of great books till a great age? why plague and perplex
childhood with complex facts remote from its experience and
inapprehensible by its imagination? The reply is, that though in
all great and combined facts there is much which childhood cannot
thoroughly imagine, there is also in very many a great deal which
can only be truly apprehended for the first time at that age. Youth
has a principle of consolidation; we begin with the whole. Small
sciences are the labors of our manhood; but the round universe is
the plaything of the boy. His fresh mind shoots out vaguely and
crudely into the infinite and eternal. Nothing is hid from the
depth of it; there are no boundaries to its vague and wandering
vision. Early science, it has been said, begins in utter nonsense;
it would be truer to say that it starts with boyish fancies. How
absurd seem the notions of the first Greeks! Who could believe now
that air or water was the principle, the pervading substance, the
eternal material of all things? Such affairs will never explain a
thick rock. And what a white original for a green and sky-blue
world! Yet people disputed in these ages not whether it was either
of those substances, but which of them it was. And doubtless there
was a great deal, at least in quantity, to be said on both sides.
Boys are improved; but some in our own day have asked, "Mamma, I
say, what did God make the world of?" and several, who did not
venture on speech, have had an idea of some one gray primitive
thing, felt a difficulty as to how the red came, and wondered that
marble could <i>ever</i> have been the same as moonshine. This is
in truth the picture of life. We begin with the infinite and
eternal, which we shall never apprehend; and these form a
framework, a schedule, a set of co-ordinates to which we refer all
which we learn later. At first, like the old Greek, "We look up to
the whole sky, and are lost in the one and the all;" in the end we
classify and enumerate, learn each star, calculate distances, draw
cramped diagrams on the unbounded sky, write a paper on a Cygni and
a treatise on e Draconis, map special facts upon the indefinite
void, and engrave precise details on the infinite and everlasting.
So in history: somehow the whole comes in boyhood, the details
later and in manhood. The wonderful series, going far back to the
times of old patriarchs with their flocks and herds, the keen-eyed
Greek, the stately Roman, the watching Jew, the uncouth Goth, the
horrid Hun, the settled picture of the unchanging East, the
restless shifting of the rapid West, the rise of the cold and
classical civilization, its fall, the rough impetuous Middle Ages,
the vague warm picture of ourselves and home,--when did we learn
these? Not yesterday nor to-day: but long ago, in the first dawn of
reason, in the original flow of fancy. What we learn afterwards are
but the accurate littlenesses of the great topic, the dates and
tedious facts. Those who begin late learn only these; but the happy
first feel the mystic associations and the progress of the
whole.</p>
<p>However exalted may seem the praises which we have given to
loose and unplanned reading, we are not saying that it is the sole
ingredient of a good education. Besides this sort of education,
which some boys will voluntarily and naturally give themselves,
there needs, of course, another and more rigorous kind, which must
be impressed upon them from without. The terrible difficulty of
early life--the <i>use</i> of pastors and masters really is, that
they compel boys to a distinct mastery of that which they do not
wish to learn. There is nothing to be said for a preceptor who is
not dry. Mr. Carlyle describes, with bitter satire, the fate of one
of his heroes who was obliged to acquire whole systems of
information in which he, the hero, saw no use, and which he kept,
as far as might be, in a vacant corner of his mind. And this is the
very point: dry language, tedious mathematics, a thumbed grammar, a
detested slate form gradually an interior separate intellect, exact
in its information, rigid in its requirements, disciplined in its
exercises. The two grow together; the early natural fancy touching
the far extremities of the universe, lightly playing with the
scheme of all things; the precise, compacted memory slowly
accumulating special facts, exact habits, clear and painful
conceptions. At last, as it were in a moment, the cloud breaks up,
the division sweeps away; we find that in fact these exercises
which puzzled us, these languages which we hated, these details
which we despised, are the instruments of true thought; are the
very keys and openings, the exclusive access to the knowledge which
we loved.</p>

<i>THE CAVALIERS</i>.<br>
Photogravure from a Painting by F. Vinea.</p>
<br>
<br>
<a name="BAGEHOT_8"></a>
<h3>THE CAVALIERS</h3>
<center>From 'Thomas Babington Macaulay'</center>
<p>What historian has ever estimated the Cavalier character? There
is Clarendon, the grave, rhetorical, decorous lawyer, piling words,
congealing arguments; very stately, a little grim. There is Hume,
the Scotch metaphysician, who has made out the best case for such
people as never were, for a Charles who never died, for a Strafford
who would never have been attainted; a saving, calculating
North-country man, fat, impassive, who lived on eightpence a day.
What have these people to do with an enjoying English gentleman? It
is easy for a doctrinaire to bear a post-mortem examination,--it is
much the same whether he be alive or dead; but not so with those
who live during their life, whose essence is existence, whose being
is in animation. There seem to be some characters who are not made
for history, as there are some who are not made for old age. A
Cavalier is always young. The buoyant life arises before us, rich
in hope, strong in vigor, irregular in action; men young and
ardent, "framed in the prodigality of nature"; open to every
enjoyment, alive to every passion, eager, impulsive; brave without
discipline, noble without principle; prizing luxury, despising
danger; capable of high sentiment, but in each of whom the</p>
<blockquote>"Addiction was to courses vain,<br>
His companies unlettered, rude, and shallow,<br>
His hours filled up with riots, banquets, sports,<br>
And never noted in him any study,<br>
Any retirement, any sequestration<br>
From open haunts and popularity."</blockquote>
<p>We see these men setting forth or assembling to defend their
king or church, and we see it without surprise; a rich daring loves
danger, a deep excitability likes excitement. If we look around us,
we may see what is analogous: some say that the battle of the Alma
was won by the "uneducated gentry"; the "uneducated gentry" would
be Cavaliers now. The political sentiment is part of the character;
the essence of Toryism is enjoyment. Talk of the ways of spreading
a wholesome conservatism throughout this country! Give painful
lectures, distribute weary tracts (and perhaps this is as
well,--you may be able to give an argumentative answer to a few
objections, you may diffuse a distinct notion of the dignified
dullness of politics); but as far as communicating and establishing
your creed are concerned, try a little pleasure. The way to keep up
old customs is to enjoy old customs; the way to be satisfied with
the present state of things is to enjoy that state of things. Over
the "Cavalier" mind this world passes with a thrill of delight;
there is an exaltation in a daily event, zest in the "regular
thing," joy at an old feast.</p>
<br>
<a name="BAGEHOT_9"></a>
<h3>MORALITY AND FEAR</h3>
<center>From 'Bishop Butler'</center>
<p>The moral principle (whatever may be said to the contrary by
complacent thinkers) is really and to most men a principle of fear.
The delights of a good conscience may be reserved for better
things, but few men who know themselves will say that they have
often felt them by vivid and actual experience; a sensation of
shame, of reproach, of remorse, of sin (to use the word we
instinctively shrink from because it expresses the meaning), is
what the moral principle really and practically thrusts on most
men. Conscience is the condemnation of ourselves; we expect a
penalty. As the Greek proverb teaches, "where there is shame there
is fear"; where there is the deep and intimate anxiety of
guilt,--the feeling which has driven murderers and other than
murderers forth to wastes and rocks and stones and tempests,--we
see, as it were, in a single complex and indivisible sensation, the
pain and sense of guilt and the painful anticipation of its
punishment. How to be free from this, is the question; how to get
loose from this; how to be rid of the secret tie which binds the
strong man and cramps his pride, and makes him angry at the beauty
of the universe,--which will not let him go forth like a great
animal, like the king of the forest, in the glory of his might, but
restrains him with an inner fear and a secret foreboding that if he
do but exalt himself he shall be abased, if he do but set forth his
own dignity he will offend ONE who will deprive him of it. This, as
has often been pointed out, is the source of the bloody rites of
heathendom. You are going to battle, you are going out in the
bright sun with dancing plumes and glittering spear; your shield
shines, and your feathers wave, and your limbs are glad with the
consciousness of strength, and your mind is warm with glory and
renown; with coming glory and unobtained renown: for who are you to
hope for these; who are <i>you</i> to go forth proudly against the
pride of the sun, with your secret sin and your haunting shame and
your real fear? First lie down and abase yourself; strike your back
with hard stripes; cut deep with a sharp knife, as if you would
eradicate the consciousness; cry aloud; put ashes on your head;
bruise yourself with stones,--then perhaps God may pardon you. Or,
better still (so runs the incoherent feeling), give him
something--your ox, your ass, whole hecatombs if you are rich
enough; anything, it is but a chance,--you do not know what will
please him; at any rate, what you love best yourself,--that is,
most likely, your first-born son. Then, after such gifts and such
humiliation, he may be appeased, he may let you off; he may without
anger let you go forth, Achilles-like, in the glory of your shield;
he may <i>not</i> send you home as he would else, the victim of
rout and treachery, with broken arms and foul limbs, in weariness
and humiliation. Of course, it is not this kind of fanaticism that
we impute to a prelate of the English Church; human sacrifices are
not respectable, and Achilles was not rector of Stanhope. But
though the costume and circumstances of life change, the human
heart does not; its feelings remain. The same anxiety, the same
consciousness of personal sin which led in barbarous times to what
has been described, show themselves in civilized life as well. In
this quieter period, their great manifestation is scrupulosity: a
care about the ritual of life; an attention to meats and drinks,
and "cups and washings." Being so unworthy as we are, feeling what
we feel, abased as we are abased, who shall say that those are
beneath us? In ardent, imaginative youth they may seem so; but let
a few years come, let them dull the will or contract the heart or
stain the mind; then the consequent feeling will be, as all
experience shows, not that a ritual is too mean, too low, too
degrading for human nature, but that it is a mercy we have to do no
more,--that we have only to wash in Jordan, that we have not even
to go out into the unknown distance to seek for Abana and Pharpar,
rivers of Damascus. We have no right to judge; we cannot decide; we
must do what is laid down for us,--we fail daily even in this; we
must never cease for a moment in our scrupulous anxiety to omit by
no tittle and to exceed by no iota.</p>
<br>
<a name="BAGEHOT_10"></a>
<h3>THE TYRANNY OF CONVENTION</h3>
<center>From 'Sir Robert Peel'</center>
<p>It might be said that this [necessity for newspapers and
statesmen of following the crowd] is only one of the results of
that tyranny of commonplace which seems to accompany civilization.
You may talk of the tyranny of Nero and Tiberius; but the real
tyranny is the tyranny of your next-door neighbor. What law is so
cruel as the law of doing what he does? What yoke is so galling as
the necessity of being like him? What espionage of despotism comes
to your door so effectually as the eye of the man who lives at your
door? Public opinion is a permeating influence, and it exacts
obedience to itself; it requires us to think other men's thoughts,
to speak other men's words, to follow other men's habits. Of
course, if we do not, no formal ban issues; no corporeal pain, no
coarse penalty of a barbarous society is inflicted on the offender;
but we are called "eccentric"; there is a gentle murmur of "most
unfortunate ideas," "singular young man," "well-intentioned, I dare
say; but unsafe, sir, quite unsafe."</p>
<p>Whatever truth there may be in these splenetic observations
might be expected to show itself more particularly in the world of
politics: people dread to be thought unsafe in proportion as they
get their living by being thought to be safe. Those who desire a
public career must look to the views of the living public; an
immediate exterior influence is essential to the exertion of their
faculties. The confidence of others is your <i>fulcrum:</i> you
cannot--many people wish you could--go into Parliament to represent
yourself; you must conform to the opinions of the electors, and
they, depend on it, will not be original. In a word, as has been
most wisely observed, "under free institutions it is necessary
occasionally to defer to the opinions of other people; and as other
people are obviously in the wrong, this is a great hindrance to the
improvement of our political system and the progress of our
species."</p>
<br>
<a name="BAGEHOT_11"></a>
<h3>HOW TO BE AN INFLUENTIAL POLITICIAN</h3>
<center>From 'Bolingbroke'</center>
<p>It is very natural that brilliant and vehement men should
depreciate Harley; for he had nothing which they possess, but had
everything which they commonly do not possess. He was by nature a
moderate man. In that age they called such a man a "trimmer," but
they called him ill: such a man does not consciously shift or
purposely trim his course,--he firmly believes that he is
substantially consistent. "I do not wish in this House," he would
say in our age, "to be a party to any extreme course. Mr. Gladstone
brings forward a great many things which I cannot understand; I
assure you he does. There is more in that bill of his about tobacco
than he thinks; I am confident there is. Money is a serious thing,
a <i>very</i> serious thing. And I am sorry to say Mr. Disraeli
commits the party very much: he avows sentiments which are
injudicious; I cannot go along with him, nor can Sir John. He was
not taught the catechism; I know he was not. There is a want in him
of sound and sober religion,--and Sir John agrees with me,--which
would keep him from distressing the clergy, who are very important.
Great orators are very well; but as I said, how is the revenue? And
the point is, not be led away, and to be moderate, and not to go to
an extreme. As soon as it seems <i>very</i> clear, then I begin to
doubt. I have been many years in Parliament, and that is my
experience." We may laugh at such speeches, but there have been
plenty of them in every English Parliament. A great English divine
has been described as always leaving out the principle upon which
his arguments rested; even if it was stated to him, he regarded it
as far-fetched and extravagant. Any politician who has this temper
of mind will always have many followers; and he may be nearly sure
that all great measures will be passed more nearly as he wishes
them to be passed than as great orators wish. Nine-tenths of
mankind are more afraid of violence than of anything else; and
inconsistent moderation is always popular, because of all qualities
it is most opposite to violence,--most likely to preserve the
present safe existence.</p>

<h3>CONDITIONS OF CABINET GOVERNMENT</h3>
<center>From 'The English Constitution'</center>
<p>The conditions of fitness are two: first, you must get a good
legislature; and next, you must keep it good. And these are by no
means so nearly connected as might be thought at first sight. To
keep a legislature efficient, it must have a sufficient supply of
substantial business: if you employ the best set of men to do
nearly nothing, they will quarrel with each other about that
nothing; where great questions end, little parties begin. And a
very happy community, with few new laws to make, few old bad laws
to repeal, and but simple foreign relations to adjust, has great
difficulty in employing a legislature,--there is nothing for it to
enact and nothing for it to settle. Accordingly, there is great
danger that the legislature, being debarred from all other kinds of
business, may take to quarreling about its elective business; that
controversies as to ministries may occupy all its time, and yet
that time be perniciously employed; that a constant succession of
feeble administrations, unable to govern and unfit to govern, may
be substituted for the proper result of cabinet government, a
sufficient body of men long enough in power to evince their
sufficiency. The exact amount of non-elective business necessary
for a parliament which is to elect the executive cannot, of course,
be formally stated,--there are no numbers and no statistics in the
theory of constitutions; all we can say is, that a parliament with
little business, which is to be as efficient as a parliament with
much business, must be in all other respects much better. An
indifferent parliament may be much improved by the steadying effect
of grave affairs; but a parliament which has no such affairs must
be intrinsically excellent, or it will fail utterly.</p>
<p>But the difficulty of keeping a good legislature is evidently
secondary to the difficulty of first getting it. There are two
kinds of nations which can elect a good parliament. The first is a
nation in which the mass of the people are intelligent, and in
which they are comfortable. Where there is no honest poverty, where
education is diffused and political intelligence is common, it is
easy for the mass of the people to elect a fair legislature. The
ideal is roughly realized in the North American colonies of
England, and in the whole free States of the Union: in these
countries there is no such thing as honest poverty,--physical
comfort, such as the poor cannot imagine here, is there easily
attainable by healthy industry; education is diffused much, and is
fast spreading,--ignorant emigrants from the Old World often prize
the intellectual advantages of which they are themselves destitute,
and are annoyed at their inferiority in a place where rudimentary
culture is so common. The greatest difficulty of such new
communities is commonly geographical: the population is mostly
scattered; and where population is sparse, discussion is difficult.
But in a country very large as we reckon in Europe, a people really
intelligent, really educated, really comfortable, would soon form a
good opinion. No one can doubt that the New England States, if they
were a separate community, would have an education, a political
capacity, and an intelligence such as the numerical majority of no
people equally numerous has ever possessed: in a State of this
sort, where all the community is fit to choose a sufficient
legislature, it is possible, it is almost easy, to create that
legislature. If the New England States possessed a cabinet
government as a separate nation, they would be as renowned in the
world for political sagacity as they now are for diffused
happiness.</p>

<h3>WHY EARLY SOCIETIES COULD NOT BE FREE</h3>
<center>From 'Physics and Politics'</center>
<p>I believe the general description in which Sir John Lubbock sums
up his estimate of the savage mind suits the patriarchal mind:
"Savages," he says, "have the character of children with the
passions and strength of men."...</p>
<p>And this is precisely what we should expect. "An inherited
drill," science says, "makes modern nations what they are; their
born structure bears the trace of the laws of their fathers:" but
the ancient nations came into no such inheritance,--they were the
descendants of people who did what was right in their own eyes;
they were born to no tutored habits, no preservative bonds, and
therefore they were at the mercy of every impulse and blown by
every passion....</p>
<p>Again, I at least cannot call up to myself the loose conceptions
(as they must have been) of morals which then existed. If we set
aside all the element derived from law and polity which runs
through our current moral notions, I hardly know what we shall have
left. The residuum was somehow and in some vague way intelligible
to the ante-political man; but it must have been uncertain,
wavering, and unfit to be depended upon. In the best cases it
existed much as the vague feeling of beauty now exists in minds
sensitive but untaught,--a still small voice of uncertain meaning,
an unknown something modifying everything else and higher than
anything else, yet in form so indistinct that when you looked for
it, it was gone; or if this be thought the delicate fiction of a
later fancy, then morality was at least to be found in the wild
spasms of "wild justice," half punishment, half outrage: but
anyhow, being unfixed by steady law, it was intermittent, vague,
and hard for us to imagine....</p>
<p>To sum up:--<i>Law</i>--rigid, definite, concise law--is the
primary want of early mankind; that which they need above anything
else, that which is requisite before they can gain anything else.
But it is their greatest difficulty as well as their first
requisite; the thing most out of their reach as well as that most
beneficial to them if they reach it. In later ages, many races have
gained much of this discipline quickly though painfully,--a loose
set of scattered clans has been often and often forced to
substantial settlement by a rigid conqueror; the Romans did half
the work for above half Europe. But where could the first ages find
Romans or a conqueror? men conquer by the power of government, and
it was exactly government which then was not. The first ascent of
civilization was at a steep gradient, though when now we look down
upon it, it seems almost nothing.</p>
<p>How the step from no polity to polity was made, distinct history
does not record.... But when once polities were begun, there is no
difficulty in explaining why they lasted. Whatever may be said
against the principle of "natural selection" in other departments,
there is no doubt of its predominance in early human history: the
strongest killed out the weakest as they could. And I need not
pause to prove that any form of polity is more efficient than none;
that an aggregate of families owning even a slippery allegiance to
a single head would be sure to have the better of a set of families
acknowledging no obedience to any one, but scattering loose about
the world and fighting where they stood. Homer's Cyclops would be
powerless against the feeblest band; so far from its being singular
that we find no other record of that state of man, so unstable and
sure to perish was it that we should rather wonder at even a single
vestige lasting down to the age when for picturesqueness it became
valuable in poetry.</p>
<p>But though the origin of polity is dubious, we are upon the
<i>terra firma</i> of actual records when we speak of the
preservation of polities. Perhaps every young Englishman who comes
nowadays to Aristotle or Plato is struck with their conservatism:
fresh from the liberal doctrines of the present age, he wonders at
finding in those recognized teachers so much contrary teaching.
They both, unlike as they are, hold with Xenophon so unlike both,
that man is "the hardest of all animals to govern." Of Plato it
might indeed be plausibly said that the adherents of an intuitive
philosophy, being "the Tories of speculation," have commonly been
prone to conservatism in government; but Aristotle, the founder of
the experience philosophy, ought according to that doctrine to have
been a Liberal if any one ever was a Liberal. In fact, both of
these men lived when men "had not had time to forget" the
difficulties of government: we have forgotten them altogether. We
reckon as the basis of our culture upon an amount of order, of
tacit obedience, of prescriptive governability, which these
philosophers hoped to get as a principal result of their culture;
we take without thought as a <i>datum</i> what they hunted as a
<i>quaesitum</i>.</p>
<p>In early times the quantity of government is much more important
than its quality. What you want is a comprehensive rule binding men
together, making them do much the same things, telling them what to
expect of each other,--fashioning them alike and keeping them so:
what this rule is, does not matter so much. A good rule is better
than a bad one, but any rule is better than none; while, for
reasons which a jurist will appreciate, none can be very good. But
to gain that rule, what may be called the "impressive" elements of
a polity are incomparably more important than its useful elements.
How to get the obedience of men, is the hard problem; what you do
with that obedience is less critical.</p>
<p>To gain that obedience, the primary condition is the
identity--not the union, but the sameness--of what we now call
"church" and "state."... No division of power is then endurable
without danger, probably without destruction: the priest must not
teach one thing and the king another; king must be priest and
prophet king,--the two must say the same because they are the same.
The idea of difference between spiritual penalties and legal
penalties must never be awakened,--indeed, early Greek thought or
early Roman thought would never have comprehended it; there was a
kind of rough public opinion, and there were rough--very
rough--hands which acted on it. We now talk of "political
penalties" and "ecclesiastical prohibition" and "the social
censure"; but they were all one then. Nothing is very like those
old communities now, but perhaps a trades-union is as near as most
things: to work cheap is thought to be a "wicked" thing, and so
some Broadhead puts it down.</p>
<p>The object of such organizations is to create what may be called
a <i>cake</i> of custom. All the actions of life are to be
submitted to a single rule for a single object,--that gradually
created "hereditary drill" which science teaches to be essential,
and which the early instinct of men saw to be essential too. That
this <i>r&eacute;gime</i> forbids free thought is not an evil,--or
rather, though an evil, it is the necessary basis for the greatest
good; it is necessary for making the mold of civilization and
hardening the soft fibre of early man.</p>

<h3>BENEFITS OF FREE DISCUSSION IN MODERN TIMES</h3>
<center>From 'Physics and Politics'</center>
<p>In this manner polities of discussion broke up the old bonds of
custom which were now strangling mankind, though they had once
aided and helped it; but this is only one of the many gifts which
those polities have conferred, are conferring, and will confer on
mankind. I am not going to write a eulogium on liberty, but I wish
to set down three points which have not been sufficiently
noticed.</p>
<p>Civilized ages inherit the human nature which was victorious in
barbarous ages, and that nature is in many respects not at all
suited to civilized circumstances. A main and principal excellence
in the early times of the human races is the impulse to action. The
problems before men are then plain and simple: the man who works
hardest, the man who kills the most deer, the man who catches the
most fish--even later on, the man who tends the largest herds or
the man who tills the largest field--is the man who succeeds; the
nation which is quickest to kill its enemies or which kills most of
its enemies is the nation which succeeds. All the inducements of
early society tend to foster immediate action, all its penalties
fall on the man who pauses; the traditional wisdom of those times
was never weary of inculcating that "delays are dangerous," and
that the sluggish man--the man "who roasteth not that which he took
in hunting"--will not prosper on the earth, and indeed will very
soon perish out of it: and in consequence an inability to stay
quiet, an irritable desire to act directly, is one of the most
conspicuous failings of mankind.</p>
<p>Pascal said that most of the evils of life arose from "man's
being unable to sit still in a room"; and though I do not go that
length, it is certain that we should have been a far wiser race
than we are if we had been readier to sit quiet,--we should have
known much better the way in which it was best to act when we came
to act. The rise of physical science, the first great body of
practical truth provable to all men, exemplifies this in the
plainest way: if it had not been for quiet people who sat still and
studied the sections of the cone, if other quiet people had not sat
still and studied the theory of infinitesimals, or other quiet
people had not sat still and worked out the doctrine of chances
(the most "dreamy moonshine," as the purely practical mind would
consider, of all human pursuits), if "idle star-gazers" had not
watched long and carefully the motions of the heavenly bodies,--our
modern astronomy would have been impossible, and without our
astronomy "our ships, our colonies, our seamen," all which makes
modern life modern life, could not have existed. Ages of sedentary,
quiet, thinking people were required before that noisy existence
began, and without those pale preliminary students it never could
have been brought into being. And nine-tenths of modern science is
in this respect the same: it is the produce of men whom their
contemporaries thought dreamers, who were laughed at for caring for
what did not concern them, who as the proverb went "walked into a
well from looking at the stars," who were believed to be useless if
any one could be such. And the conclusion is plain that if there
had been more such people, if the world had not laughed at those
there were, if rather it had encouraged them, there would have been
a great accumulation of proved science ages before there was. It
was the irritable activity, the "wish to be doing something," that
prevented it,--most men inherited a nature too eager and too
restless to be quiet and find out things: and even worse, with
their idle clamor they "disturbed the brooding hen"; they would not
let those be quiet who wished to be so, and out of whose calm
thought much good might have come forth.</p>
<p>If we consider how much science has done and how much it is
doing for mankind, and if the over-activity of men is proved to be
the cause why science came so late into the world and is so small
and scanty still, that will convince most people that our
over-activity is a very great evil; but this is only part and
perhaps not the greatest part, of the harm that over-activity does.
As I have said, it is inherited from times when life was simple,
objects were plain, and quick action generally led to desirable
ends: if A kills B before B kills A, then A survives, and the human
race is a race of A's. But the issues of life are plain no longer:
to act rightly in modern society requires a great deal of previous
study, a great deal of assimilated information, a great deal of
sharpened imagination; and these prerequisites of sound action
require much time, and I was going to say much "lying in the sun,"
a long period of "mere passiveness."</p>
<p>[Argument to show that the same vice of impatience damages war,
philanthropy, commerce, and even speculation.]</p>
<p>But it will be said, What has government by discussion to do
with these things? will it prevent them, or even mitigate them? It
can and does do both, in the very plainest way. If you want to stop
instant and immediate action, always make it a condition that the
action shall not begin till a considerable number of persons have
talked over it and have agreed on it. If those persons be people of
different temperaments, different ideas, and different educations,
you have an almost infallible security that nothing or almost
nothing will be done with excessive rapidity. Each kind of persons
will have their spokesman; each spokesman will have his
characteristic objection and each his characteristic
counter-proposition: and so in the end nothing will probably be
done, or at least only the minimum which is plainly urgent. In many
cases this delay may be dangerous, in many cases quick action will
be preferable; a campaign, as Macaulay well says, cannot be
directed by a "debating society," and many other kinds of action
also require a single and absolute general: but for the purpose now
in hand--that of preventing hasty action and insuring elaborate
consideration--there is no device like a polity of discussion.</p>
<p>The enemies of this object--the people who want to act
quickly--see this very distinctly: they are forever explaining that
the present is "an age of committees," that the committees do
nothing, that all evaporates in talk. Their great enemy is
parliamentary government: they call it, after Mr. Carlyle, the
"national palaver"; they add up the hours that are consumed in it
and the speeches which are made in it, and they sigh for a time
when England might again be ruled, as it once was, by a
Cromwell,--that is, when an eager absolute man might do exactly
what other eager men wished, and do it immediately. All these
invectives are perpetual and many-sided; they come from
philosophers each of whom wants some new scheme tried, from
philanthropists who want some evil abated, from revolutionists who
want some old institution destroyed, from new-eraists who want
their new era started forthwith: and they all are distinct
admissions that a polity of discussion is the greatest hindrance to
the inherited mistake of human nature,--to the desire to act
promptly, which in a simple age is so excellent, but which in a
later and complex time leads to so much evil.</p>
<p>The same accusation against our age sometimes takes a more
general form: it is alleged that our energies are diminishing, that
ordinary and average men have not the quick determination nowadays
which they used to have when the world was younger, that not only
do not committees and parliaments act with rapid decisiveness, but
that no one now so acts; and I hope that in fact this is true, for
according to me it proves that the hereditary barbaric impulse is
decaying and dying out. So far from thinking the quality attributed
to us a defect, I wish that those who complain of it were far more
right than I much fear they are. Still, certainly, eager and
violent action <i>is</i> somewhat diminished, though only by a
small fraction of what it ought to be; and I believe that this is
in great part due, in England at least, to our government by
discussion, which has fostered a general intellectual tone, a
diffused disposition to weigh evidence, a conviction that much may
be said on every side of everything which the elder and more
fanatic ages of the world wanted. This is the real reason why our
energies seem so much less than those of our fathers. When we have
a definite end in view, which we know we want and which we think we
know how to obtain, we can act well enough: the campaigns of our
soldiers are as energetic as any campaigns ever were; the
speculations of our merchants have greater promptitude, greater
audacity, greater vigor than any such speculations ever had before.
In old times a few ideas got possession of men and communities, but
this is happily now possible no longer: we see how incomplete these
old ideas were; how almost by chance one seized on one nation and
another on another; how often one set of men have persecuted
another set for opinions on subjects of which neither, we now
perceive, knew anything. It might be well if a greater number of
effectual demonstrations existed among mankind: but while no such
demonstrations exist, and while the evidence which completely
convinces one man seems to another trifling and insufficient, let
us recognize the plain position of inevitable doubt; let us not be
bigots with a doubt and persecutors without a creed. We are
beginning to see this, and we are railed at for so beginning: but
it is a great benefit, and it is to the incessant prevalence of
detective discussion that our doubts are due; and much of that
discussion is due to the long existence of a government requiring
constant debates, written and oral.</p>

<h3>ORIGIN OF DEPOSIT BANKING</h3>
<center>From 'Lombard Street'</center>
<p>In the last century, a favorite subject of literary ingenuity
was "conjectural history," as it was then called: upon grounds of
probability, a fictitious sketch was made of the possible origin of
things existing. If this kind of speculation were now applied to
banking, the natural and first idea would be that large systems of
deposit banking grew up in the early world just as they grow up now
in any large English colony. As soon as any such community becomes
rich enough to have much money, and compact enough to be able to
lodge its money in single banks, it at once begins so to do.
English colonists do not like the risk of keeping their money, and
they wish to make an interest on it; they carry from home the idea
and the habit of banking, and they take to it as soon as they can
in their new world. Conjectural history would be inclined to say
that all banking began thus; but such history is rarely of any
value,--the basis of it is false. It assumes that what works most
easily when established is that which it would be the most easy to
establish, and that what seems simplest when familiar would be most
easily appreciated by the mind though unfamiliar; but exactly the
contrary is true,--many things which seem simple, and which work
well when firmly established, are very hard to establish among new
people and not very easy to explain to them. Deposit banking is of
this sort. Its essence is, that a very large number of persons
agree to trust a very few persons, or some one person: banking
would not be a profitable trade if bankers were not a small number,
and depositors in comparison an immense number. But to get a great
number of persons to do exactly the same thing is always very
difficult, and nothing but a very palpable necessity will make them
on a sudden begin to do it; and there is no such palpable necessity
in banking.</p>
<p>If you take a country town in France, even now, you will not
find any such system of banking as ours: check-books are unknown,
and money kept on running account by bankers is rare: people store
their money in a <i>caisse</i> at their houses. Steady savings,
which are waiting for investment and which are sure not to be soon
wanted, may be lodged with bankers; but the common floating cash of
the community is kept by the community themselves at home,--they
prefer to keep it so, and it would not answer a banker's purpose to
make expensive arrangements for keeping it otherwise. If a
"branch," such as the National Provincial Bank opens in an English
country town, were opened in a corresponding French one, it would
not pay its expenses: you could not get any sufficient number of
Frenchmen to agree to put their money there.</p>
<p>And so it is in all countries not of British descent, though in
various degrees. Deposit banking is a very difficult thing to
begin, because people do not like to let their money out of their
sight; especially, do not like to let it out of sight without
security; still more, cannot all at once agree on any single person
to whom they are content to trust it unseen and unsecured.
Hypothetical history, which explains the past by what is simplest
and commonest in the present, is in banking, as in most things,
quite untrue.</p>
<p>The real history is very different. New wants are mostly
supplied by adaptation, not by creation or foundation; something
having been created to satisfy an extreme want, it is used to
satisfy less pressing wants or to supply additional conveniences.
On this account, political government, the oldest institution in
the world, has been the hardest worked: at the beginning of
history, we find it doing everything which society wants done and
forbidding everything which society does <i>not</i> wish done. In
trade, at present, the first commerce in a new place is a general
shop, which, beginning with articles of real necessity, comes
shortly to supply the oddest accumulation of petty comforts. And
the history of banking has been the same: the first banks were not
founded for our system of deposit banking, or for anything like it;
they were founded for much more pressing reasons, and having been
founded, they or copies from them were applied to our modern
uses.</p>
<p>[Gives a sketch of banks started as finance companies to make or
float government loans, and to give good coin; and sketches their
function of remitting money.]</p>
<p>These are all uses other than those of deposit banking, which
banks supplied that afterwards became in our English sense deposit
banks: by supplying these uses, they gained the credit that
afterwards enabled them to gain a living as deposit banks; being
trusted for one purpose, they came to be trusted for a purpose
quite different,--ultimately far more important, though at first
less keenly pressing. But these wants only affect a few persons,
and therefore bring the bank under the notice of a few only. The
real introductory function which deposit banks at first perform is
much more popular; and it is only when they can perform this most
popular kind of business that deposit banking ever spreads quickly
and extensively.</p>
<p>This function is the supply of the paper circulation to the
country; and it will be observed that I am not about to overstep my
limits and discuss this as a question of currency. In what form the
best paper currency can be supplied to a country is a question of
economical theory with which I do not meddle here: I am only
narrating unquestionable history, not dealing with an argument
where every step is disputed; and part of this certain history is,
that the best way to diffuse banking in a community is to allow the
banker to issue bank notes of small amount that can supersede the
metal currency. This amounts to a subsidy to each banker to enable
him to keep open a bank till depositors choose to come to
it....</p>
<p>The reason why the use of bank paper commonly precedes the habit
of making deposits in banks is very plain: it is a far easier habit
to establish. In the issue of notes the banker, the person to be
most benefited, can do something,--he can pay away his own
"promises" in loans, in wages, or in payment of debts,--but in the
getting of deposits he is passive; his issues depend on himself,
his deposits on the favor of others. And to the public the change
is far easier too: to collect a great mass of deposits with the
same banker, a great number of persons must agree to do something;
but to establish a note circulation, a large number of persons need
only <i>do nothing</i>,--they receive the banker's notes in the
common course of their business, and they have only <i>not</i> to
take those notes to the banker for payment. If the public refrain
from taking trouble, a paper circulation is immediately in
existence. A paper circulation is begun by the banker, and requires
no effort on the part of the public,--on the contrary, it needs an
effort of the public to be rid of notes once issued; but deposit
banking cannot be begun by the banker, and requires a spontaneous
and consistent effort in the community: and therefore paper issue
is the natural prelude to deposit banking.</p>

<h2>JENS <a name="BAGGESEN"></a>BAGGESEN</h2>
<h3>(1764-1826)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-j.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>ens Baggesen was born in the little Danish town Kors&ouml;r in
1764, and died in exile in the year 1826. Thus he belonged to two
centuries and to two literary periods. He had reached manhood when
the French Revolution broke out; he witnessed Napoleon's rise, his
victories, and his fall. He was a full contemporary of Goethe, who
survived him only six years; he saw English literature glory in men
like Byron and Moore, and lived to hear of Byron's death in Greece.
In his first works he stood a true representative of the culture
and literature of the eighteenth century, and was hailed as its
exponent by the Danish poet Herman Wessel; towards the end of the
century he was acknowledged to be the greatest of living Danish
poets. Then with the new age came the Norwegian, Henrik Steffens,
with his enthusiastic lectures on German romanticism, calling out
the genius of Oehlenschl&auml;ger, and the eighteenth century was
doomed; Baggesen nevertheless greeted Oehlenschl&auml;ger with
sincere admiration, and when the 'Aladdin' of that poet appeared,
Baggesen sent him his rhymed letter 'From Nureddin-Baggesen to
Aladdin-Oehlenschl&auml;ger.'</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/image290.png" width="40%" alt=

<b>JENS BAGGESEN.</b></p>
<p>Baggesen was the son of poor people, and strangers helped him to
his scientific education. When his first works were recognized he
became the friend and prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the Duke of
Augustenborg, who provided him with the means for an extended
journey through the Continent, during which he met the greatest men
of his time. The Duke of Augustenborg meanwhile secured him several
positions, which could not hold him for any length of time, nor
keep him at home in Denmark. He went abroad a second time to study
pedagogics, literature, and philosophy, came home again, wandered
forth once more, returned a widower, was for some time director of
the National Theatre in Copenhagen; but found no rest, married
again, and in 1800 went to France to live. Eleven years later he
was professor in Kiel, returning thence to Copenhagen, where
meanwhile his fame had been eclipsed by the genius of
Oehlenschl&auml;ger. Secure in the knowledge of his powers,
Oehlenschl&auml;ger had carelessly published two or three dramatic
poems not worthy of his pen, and Baggesen entered on a violent
controversy with him in which he stood practically by himself
against the entire reading public, whose sympathies were with
Oehlenschl&auml;ger. Alone and misunderstood, restless and unhappy,
he left Denmark in 1820, never to return. Six years later he died,
longing to see his country again, but unable to reach it.</p>
<p>His first poetry was published in 1785, a volume of 'Comic
Tales,' which made its mark at once. The following year appeared in
quick succession satires, rhymed epistles, and elegies, which,
adding to his fame, added also to the purposeless ferment and
unrest which had taken possession of him. He considered tragedy his
proper field, yet had allowed himself to appear as humorist and
satirist.</p>
<p>When the great historic events of the time took place, and
over-threw all existing conditions, this inner restlessness drove
him to and fro without purpose or will. One day he was enthusiastic
over Voss's idyls, the next he was carried away by Robespierre's
wildest speeches. One year he adopted Kant's Christian name
Immanuel in transport over his works, the next he called the great
philosopher "an empty nut, and moreover hard to crack." The
romanticism in Denmark as well as in Germany reduced him to a state
of utter confusion; but in spite of this he continued a child of
the old order, which was already doomed. And with all his unrest
and discord he remained nevertheless the champion of "form," "the
poet of the graces," as he has been called.</p>
<p>This gift of form has given him his literary importance. He
built a bridge from the eighteenth to the nineteenth century; and
when the new romantic school overstepped its privileges, it was he
who called it to order. The most conspicuous act of his literary
life was the controversy with Oehlenschl&auml;ger, and the wittiest
product of his pen is the reckless criticism of
Oehlenschl&auml;ger's opera 'Ludlam's Cave.' Johann Ludvig Heiberg,
the greatest analytical critic of whom Denmark can boast, remained
Baggesen's ardent admirer; and Heiberg's influential although not
always just criticism of Oehlenschl&auml;ger as a poet was no doubt
called forth by Baggesen's attack. Some years later Henrik Hertz
made Baggesen his subject. In 1830 appeared 'Letters from Ghosts,'
poetic epistles from Paradise. Nobody knew that Hertz was the
author. It was Baggesen's voice from beyond the grave, Baggesen's
criticism upon the literature of 1830. It was one of the wittiest,
and in versification one of the best, books in Danish
literature.</p>
<p>Baggesen's most important prose work is 'The Labyrinth,'
afterwards called 'The Wanderings of a Poet.' It is a poetic
description of his journeys, unique in its way, rich in impressions
and full of striking remarks, written in a piquant, graceful, and
easy style.</p>
<p>As long as Danish literature remains, Baggesen's name will be
known; though his writings are not now widely read, and are
important chiefly because of their influence on the literary spirit
of his own time. His familiar poem 'There was a time when I was
very little,' during the controversy with Oehlenschl&auml;ger, was
seized upon by Paul M&ouml;ller, parodied, and changed into 'There
was a time when Jens was much bigger.' Equally well known is his
'Ode to My Country,' with the familiar lines:--</p>
<blockquote>"Alas, in no place is the thorn as tiny,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, in no place blooms as red a rose,<br>
Alas, in no place is there couch as downy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As where we little children found repose."</blockquote>

<h3>A COSMOPOLITAN</h3>
<center>From 'The Labyrinth'</center>
<p>Forster, a little nervous, alert, and piquant man, with gravity
written on his forehead, perspicacity in his eye, and love around
his lips, conquered me completely. I spoke to him of everything
except his journeys; but the traveler showed himself full of
unmistakable humanity. He seemed to me the cosmopolitan spirit
personified. It was as if the world were present when I was alone
with him.</p>
<p>We talked about his friend Jacobi, about the late King of
Prussia, about the literature of Germany, and about the present
Pole-high standard of taste. I was much pleased to find in him the
art critic I sought. He said that we must admire everything which
is good and beautiful, whether it originates West, East, South, or
North. The taste of the bee is the true one. Difference in language
and climate, difference of nationality, must not affect my interest
in fair and noble things. The unknown repels the animal, but should
not repel the human creature. Suppose you say that Voltaire is
animal in comparison with Shakespeare or Klopstock, or that they
are animal in comparison with him: it is a blunder to demand pears
of an apple-tree, as it is ridiculous to throw away the apple
because it is not a pear. The entire world of nature teaches us
this aesthetic tolerance, and yet we have as little acquired it as
we have freedom of conscience. We plant white and red roses in the
same bed, but who puts the 'Messiah' and the 'Henriade' on the same
shelf? He only who reads neither the one nor the other. True
religion worships God; true taste worships the beautiful without
regard of person or nation. German? French? Italian? or English?
All the same! But nothing mediocre.</p>
<p>I was flushed with pleasure; I gave him my hand. "That may be
said of other things than poetry!" I said.--"Of all art!" he
answered.--"Of all that is human!" we both concluded.</p>
<p>Deplorable indolence which clothes our mind in the first heavy
cloak ready to hand, so that all the sunbeams of the world cannot
persuade us to throw it off, much less to assume another! The man
who is exclusively a nationalist is a snail forever chained to his
house. Psyche had wings given her for a never-ending, eternal
flight. We may not imprison her, be the cage ever so large.</p>
<p>He considered that Lessing had wronged the great representative
of the French language; and the remark of Claudius, "Voltaire says
he weeps, and Shakespeare does weep," appeared to him like the
saying, "Much that is new and beautiful has M. Arouet said; but it
is a pity that the beautiful is not new and the new not
beautiful,"--more witty than true. The English think that
Shakespeare, as the Germans think that Lessing, really weeps; the
French think the same of Voltaire. But the first weeps for the
whole world, it is said, the last only for his own people. What the
French call "Le Nord" is, to be sure, rather a large territory, but
not the entire world! France calls "whimpering" in one case and
"blubbering" in another what we call weeping. The general mistake
is that we do not understand the nature of the people and the
language, in which and for whom the weeping is done.</p>
<p>We must be English when we read Shakespeare, German when we read
Klopstock, French when we read Voltaire. The man whose soul cannot
shed its national costume and don that of other nations ought not
to read, much less to judge, their masterpieces. He will be looking
at the moon by day and at the sun by night, and see the first
without lustre and the last not at all.</p>

<h3>PHILOSOPHY ON THE HEATH</h3>
<center>From 'The Labyrinth'</center>
<p>Caillard was a man of experience, taste, and knowledge. He told
me the story of his life from beginning to end, he confided to me
his principles and his affairs, and I took him to be the happiest
man in the world. "I have everything," he said, "all that I have
wished for or can wish for: health, riches, domestic peace (being
unmarried), a tolerably good conscience, books--and as much sense
as I need to enjoy them. I experience only one single want, lack
only one single pleasure in this world; but that one is enough to
embitter my life and class me with other unfortunates."</p>
<p>I could not guess what might yet be wanting to such a man under
such conditions, "It cannot be liberty," I said, "for how can a
rich merchant in a free town lack this?"</p>
<p>"No! Heaven save me--I neither would nor could live one single
day without liberty."</p>
<p>"You do not happen to be in love with some cruel or unhappy
princess?"</p>
<p>"That is still less the case."</p>
<p>"Ah!--now I have it, no doubt--your soul is consumed with a
thirst for truth, for a satisfactory answer to the many questions
which are but philosophic riddles. You are seeking what so many
brave men from Anaxagoras to Spinoza have sought in vain--the
corner-stone of philosophy, the foundation of the structure of our
ideas."</p>
<p>He assured me that in this respect he was quite at ease. "Then,
in spite of your good health, you must be subject to that miserable
thing, a cold in the head?" I said.</p>
<center>"Uno minor--Jove, dives<br>
Liber, honoratus, pulcher rex denique regum,<br>
Praecipue sanus--nisi cum pituita molesta est."<br>
<br>
--HORACE.</center>
<br>
<p>When he denied this too, I gave up trying to solve the meaning
of his dark words.</p>
<p>O happiness! of all earthly chimeras thou art the most
chimerical! I would rather seek dry figs on the bottom of the sea
and fresh ones on this heath,--I would rather seek liberty, or
truth itself, or the philosopher's stone, than to run after thee,
most deceitful of lights, will-o'-the-wisp of our human life!</p>
<p>I thought that at last I had found a perfectly happy, an
enviable man; and now--behold! though I have not the ten-thousandth
part of his wealth, though I have not the tenth part of his health,
though I may not have a third of his intellect, although I have all
the wants which he has not and the one want under which he suffers,
yet I would not change places with him!</p>
<p>From this moment he was the object of my sincerest pity. But
what did this awful curse prove to be? Listen and tremble!</p>
<p>"Of what use is it all to me?" he said: "coffee, which I love
more than all the wines of this earth and more than all the women
of this earth, coffee which I love madly--coffee is forbidden
me!"</p>
<p>Laugh who lists! Inasmuch as everything in this world, viewed in
a certain light, is tragic, it would be excusable to weep: but
inasmuch as everything viewed in another light is comic, a little
laughter could not be taken amiss; only beware of laughing at the
sigh with which my happy man pronounced these words, for it might
be that in laughing at him you laugh at yourself, your father, your
grandfather, your great-grandfather, your great-great-grandfather,
and so on, including your entire family as far back as Adam.</p>
<p>If, in laughing at such discontent, you laugh in advance at your
son, your son's son's son, and so forth to the last descendant of
your entire family, this is a matter which I do not decide. It will
depend upon the road humanity chooses to take. If it continues as
it is going, some coffee-want or other will forever strew it with
thorns.</p>
<p>Had he said, "Chocolate is forbidden me," or tea, or English
ale, or madeira, or strawberries, you would have found his misery
equally absurd.</p>
<p>The great Alexander is said to have wept because he found no
more worlds to conquer. The man who bemoans the loss of a world and
the man who bemoans the loss of coffee are to my mind equally
unbalanced and equally in need of forgiveness. The desire for a cup
of coffee and the desire for a crown, the hankering after the
flavor or even the fragrance of the drink and the hankering after
fame, are equally mad and equally--human.</p>
<p>If history is to be believed, Adam possessed all the advantages
and comforts, all the necessities and luxuries a first man could
reasonably demand.... Lord of all living things, and sharing his
dominion with his beloved, what did he lack?</p>
<p>Among ten thousand pleasures, the fruit of one single tree was
forbidden him. Good-by content and peace! Good-by forever all his
bliss!</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I should have yielded to the same temptation;
and he who does not see that this fate would have overtaken his
entire family, past and to come, may have studied all things from
the Milky Way in the sky to the milky way in his kitchen, may have
studied all stones, plants, and animals, and all folios and quartos
dealing therewith, but never himself or man.</p>
<p>As we do not know the nature of the fruit which Adam could not
do without, it may as well have been coffee as any other. That it
was pleasant to the eyes means no more than that it was forbidden.
Every forbidden thing is pleasant to the eyes.</p>
<p>"Of what use is it all to me?" said Adam, looking around him in
Eden, at the rising sun, the blushing hills, the light-green
forest, the glorious waterfall, the laden fruit-trees, and, most
beautiful of all, the smiling woman--"of what use is it all to me,
when I dare not taste this--coffee bean?"</p>
<p>"And of what use is it all to me?" said Mr. Caillard, and looked
around him on the L&uuml;neburg heath: "coffee is forbidden me; one
single cup of coffee would kill me."</p>
<p>"If it will be any comfort to you," I said, "I may tell you that
I am in the same case." "And you do not despair at times?"--"No," I
replied, "for it is not my only want. If like you I had everything
else in life, I also might despair."</p>

<h2>PHILIP JAMES <a name="BAILEY"></a>BAILEY</h2>
<h3>(1816-)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-i.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>n Bailey we have a striking instance of the man whose reputation
is made suddenly by a single work, which obtains an amazing
popularity, and which is presently almost forgotten except as a
name. When in 1839 the long poem 'Festus' appeared, its author was
an unknown youth, who had hardly reached his majority. Within a few
months he was a celebrity. That so dignified and suggestive a
performance should have come from so young a poet was considered a
marvel of precocity by the literary world, both English and
American.</p>
<p>The author of 'Festus' was born at Basford, Nottinghamshire,
England, April 22nd, 1816. Educated at the public schools of
Nottingham, and at Glasgow University, he studied law, and at
nineteen entered Lincoln's Inn. In 1840 he was admitted to the bar.
But his vocation in life appears to have been metaphysical and
spiritual rather than legal.</p>
<p>His 'Festus: a Poem,' containing fifty-five episodes or
successive scenes,--some thirty-five thousand lines,--was begun in
his twentieth year. Three years later it was in the hands of the
English reading public. Like Goethe's 'Faust' in pursuing the
course of a human soul through influences emanating from the
Supreme Good and the Supreme Evil; in having Heaven and the World
as its scene; in its inclusion of God and the Devil, the Archangels
and Angels, the Powers of Perdition, and withal many earthly types
in its action,--it is by no means a mere imitation of the great
German. Its plan is wider. It incorporates even more impressive
spiritual material than 'Faust' offers. Not only is its mortal
hero, Festus, conducted through an amazing pilgrimage, spiritual
and redeemed by divine Love, but we have in the poem a conception
of close association with Christianity, profound ethical
suggestions, a flood of theology and philosophy, metaphysics and
science, picturing Good and Evil, love and hate, peace and war, the
past, the present, and the future, earth, heaven, and hell, heights
and depths, dominions, principalities, and powers, God and man, the
whole of being and of not-being,--all in an effort to unmask the
last and greatest secrets of Infinity. And more than all this,
'Festus' strives to portray the sufficiency of Divine Love and of
the Divine Atonement to dissipate, even to annihilate, Evil. For
even Lucifer and the hosts of darkness are restored to purity and
to peace among the Sons of God, the Children of Light! The Love of
God is set forth as limitless. We have before us the birth of
matter at the Almighty's fiat; and we close the work with the
salvation and ecstasy--described as decreed from the Beginning--of
whatever creature hath been given a spiritual existence, and made a
spiritual subject and agency. There is in the doctrine of 'Festus'
no such thing as the "Son of Perdition" who shall be an ultimate
castaway.</p>
<p>Few English poems have attracted more general notice from all
intelligent classes of readers than did 'Festus' on its advent.
Orthodoxy was not a little aghast at its theologic suggestions.
Criticism of it as a literary production was hampered not a little
by religious sensitiveness. The London Literary Gazette said of
it:--"It is an extraordinary production, out-Heroding Kant in some
of its philosophy, and out-Goetheing Goethe in the introduction of
the Three Persons of the Trinity as interlocutors in its wild plot.
Most objectionable as it is on this account, it yet contains so
many exquisite passages of genuine poetry, that our admiration of
the author's genius overpowers the feeling of mortification at its
being misapplied, and meddling with such dangerous topics." The
advance of liberal ideas within the churches has diminished such
criticism, but the work is still a stumbling-block to the less
speculative of sectaries.</p>
<p>The poem is far too long, and its scope too vast for even a
genius of much higher and riper gifts than Bailey's. It is turgid,
untechnical in verse, wordy, and involved. Had Bailey written at
fifty instead of at twenty, it might have shown a necessary balance
and felicity of style. But, with all these shortcomings, it is not
to be relegated to the library of things not worth the time to
know, to the list of bulky poetic failures. Its author blossomed
and fruited marvelously early; so early and with such unlooked-for
fruit that the unthinking world, which first received him with
exaggerated honor, presently assailed him with undue dispraise.
'Festus' is not mere solemn and verbose commonplace. Here and there
it has passages of great force and even of high beauty. The
author's whole heart and brain were poured into it, and neither was
a common one. With all its ill-based daring and manifest crudities,
it was such a <i>tour de force</i> for a lad of twenty as the world
seldom sees. Its sluggish current bears along remarkable knowledge,
great reflection, and the imagination of a fertile as well as a
precocious brain. It is a stream which carries with it things new
and old, and serves to stir the mind of the onlooker with unwonted
thoughts. Were it but one fourth as long, it would still remain a
favorite poem. Even now it has passed through numerous editions,
and been but lately republished in sumptuous form after fifty years
of life; and in the catalogue of higher metaphysico-religious
poetry it will long maintain an honorable place. It is cited here
among the books whose fame rather than whose importance
<i>demand</i> recognition.</p>

<p><i>Festus</i>--I would it were. This life's a mystery.</p>
<p>The value of a thought cannot be told;</p>
<p>But it is clearly worth a thousand lives</p>
<p>Like many men's. And yet men love to live</p>
<p>As if mere life were worth their living for.</p>
<p>What but perdition will it be to most?</p>
<p>Life's more than breath and the quick round of blood;</p>
<p>It is a great spirit and a busy heart.</p>
<p>The coward and the small in soul scarce do live.</p>
<p>One generous feeling--one great thought--one deed</p>
<p>Of good, ere night, would make life longer seem</p>
<p>Than if each year might number a thousand days,</p>
<p>Spent as is this by nations of mankind.</p>
<p>We live in deeds, not years; in thoughts, not breaths;</p>
<p>In feelings, not in figures on a dial.</p>
<p>We should count time by heart-throbs. He most lives</p>
<p>Who thinks most--feels the noblest--acts the best.</p>
<p>Life's but a means unto an end--that end</p>
<p>Beginning, mean, and end to all things--God.</p>
<p>The dead have all the glory of the world.</p>
<p>Why will we live and not be glorious?</p>
<p>We never can be deathless till we die.</p>
<p>It is the dead win battles. And the breath</p>
<p>Of those who through the world drive like a wedge,</p>
<p>Tearing earth's empires up, nears Death so close</p>
<p>It dims his well-worn scythe. But no! the brave</p>
<p>Die never. Being deathless, they but change</p>
<p>Their country's arms for more--their country's heart.</p>
<p>Give then the dead their due: it is they who saved us.</p>
<p>The rapid and the deep--the fall, the gulph,</p>
<p>Have likenesses in feeling and in life.</p>
<p>And life, so varied, hath more loveliness</p>
<p>In one day than a creeping century</p>
<p>Of sameness. But youth loves and lives on change,</p>
<p>Till the soul sighs for sameness; which at last</p>
<p>Becomes variety, and takes its place.</p>
<p>Yet some will last to die out, thought by thought,</p>
<p>And power by power, and limb of mind by limb,</p>
<p>Like lamps upon a gay device of glass,</p>
<p>Till all of soul that's left be dry and dark;</p>
<p>Till even the burden of some ninety years</p>
<p>Hath crashed into them like a rock; shattered</p>
<p>Their system as if ninety suns had rushed</p>
<p>To ruin earth--or heaven had rained its stars;</p>
<p>Till they become like scrolls, unreadable,</p>
<p>Through dust and mold. Can they be cleaned and read?</p>
<p>Do human spirits wax and wane like moons?</p>

<p>FESTUS--Well, farewell, Mr. Student. May you never</p>
<p>Regret those hours which make the mind, if they</p>
<p>Unmake the body; for the sooner we</p>
<p>Are fit to be all mind, the better. Blessed</p>
<p>Is he whose heart is the home of the great dead,</p>
<p>And their great thoughts. Who can mistake great thoughts</p>
<p>They seize upon the mind; arrest and search,</p>
<p>And shake it; bow the tall soul as by wind;</p>
<p>Rush over it like a river over reeds,</p>
<p>Which quaver in the current; turn us cold,</p>
<p>And pale, and voiceless; leaving in the brain</p>
<p>A rocking and a ringing; glorious,</p>
<p>But momentary, madness might it last,</p>
<p>And close the soul with heaven as with a seal!</p>
<p>In lieu of all these things whose loss thou mournest,</p>
<p>If earnestly or not I know not, use</p>
<p>The great and good and true which ever live;</p>
<p>And are all common to pure eyes and true.</p>
<p>Upon the summit of each mountain-thought</p>
<p>Worship thou God, with heaven-uplifted head</p>
<p>And arms horizon-stretched; for deity is seen</p>
<p>From every elevation of the soul.</p>
<p>Study the light; attempt the high; seek out</p>
<p>The soul's bright path; and since the soul is fire,</p>
<p>Of heat intelligential, turn it aye</p>
<p>To the all-Fatherly source of light and life;</p>
<p>Piety purifies the soul to see</p>
<p>Visions, perpetually, of grace and power,</p>
<p>Which, to their sight who in ignorant sin abide,</p>
<p>Are now as e'er incognizable. Obey</p>
<p>Thy genius, for a minister it is</p>
<p>Unto the throne of Fate. Draw towards thy soul,</p>
<p>And centralize, the rays which are around</p>
<p>Of the divinity. Keep thy spirit pure</p>
<p>From worldly taint, by the repellent strength</p>
<p>Of virtue. Think on noble thoughts and deeds,</p>
<p>Ever. Count o'er the rosary of truth;</p>
<p>And practice precepts which are proven wise,</p>
<p>It matters not then what thou fearest. Walk</p>
<p>Boldly and wisely in that light thou hast;--</p>
<p>There is a hand above will help thee on.</p>
<p>I am an omnist, and believe in all</p>
<p>Religions; fragments of one golden world</p>
<p>To be relit yet, and take its place in heaven,</p>
<p>Where is the whole, sole truth, in deity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his word, his law, writ soulwise here,</p>

<p>Not all the agony maybe of the damned</p>
<p>Fused in one pang, vies with that earthquake throb</p>

<h2>JOANNA <a name="BAILLIE"></a>BAILLIE</h2>
<h3>(1762-1851)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-j.png" width="30%" alt=

<p>oanna Baillie's early childhood was passed at Bothwell,
Scotland, where she was born in 1762. Of this time she drew a
picture in her well-known birthday lines to her sister:--</p>
<blockquote>"Dear Agnes, gleamed with joy, and dashed with tears,
O'er us have glided almost sixty years Since we on Bothwell's bonny
braes were seen, By those whose eyes long closed in death have
been: Two tiny imps, who scarcely stooped to gather The slender
harebell, or the purple heather; No taller than the foxglove's
spiky stem, That dew of morning studs with silvery gem. Then every
butterfly that crossed our view With joyful shout was greeted as it
flew, And moth and lady-bird and beetle bright In sheeny gold were
each a wondrous sight. Then as we paddled barefoot, side by side,
Among the sunny shallows of the Clyde, Minnows or spotted par with
twinkling fin, Swimming in mazy rings the pool within, A thrill of
gladness through our bosoms sent Seen in the power of early
wonderment."</blockquote>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/image308.png" width="40%" alt=
""><br>
<b>JOANNA BAILLIE.</b></p>
<p>When Joanna was six her father was appointed to the charge of
the kirk at Hamilton. Her early growth went on, not in books, but
in the fearlessness with which she ran upon the top of walls and
parapets of bridges and in all daring. "Look at Miss Jack," said a
farmer, as she dashed by: "she sits her horse as if it were a bit
of herself." At eleven she could not read well. "'Twas thou," she
said in lines to her sister--</p>
<blockquote>"'Twas thou who woo'dst me first to look<br>
Upon the page of printed book,<br>
That thing by me abhorred, and with address<br>
Didst win me from my thoughtless idleness,<br>
When all too old become with bootless haste<br>
In fitful sports the precious time to waste.<br>
Thy love of tale and story was the stroke<br>
At which my dormant fancy first awoke,<br>
And ghosts and witches in my busy brain<br>
Arose in sombre show, a motley train."</blockquote>
<p>In 1776 Dr. James Baillie was made Professor of Divinity at
Glasgow University. During the two years the family lived in the
college atmosphere, Joanna first read 'Comus,' and, led by the
delight it awakened, the great epic of Milton. It was here that her
vigor and disputatious turn of mind "cast an awe" over her
companions. After her father's death she settled, in 1784, with her
mother and brother and sister in London.</p>
<p>She had made herself familiar with English literature, and above
all she had studied Shakespeare with enthusiasm. Circumscribed now
by the brick and mortar of London streets, in exchange for the fair
views and liberties of her native fruitlands, Joanna found her
first expression in a volume of 'Fugitive Verses,' published in
1790. The book caused so little comment that the words of but one
friendly hand are preserved: that the poems were "truly
unsophisticated representations of nature."</p>
<p>Joanna's walk was along calm and unhurried ways. She could have
had a considerable place in society and the world of "lions" if she
had cared. The wife of her uncle and name-father, the anatomist Dr.
John Hunter, was no other than the famous Mrs. Anne Hunter, a
songwright of genius; her poem 'The Son of Alknomook Shall Never
Complain' is one of the classics of English song, and the best
rendering of the Indian spirit ever condensed into so small a
space. She was also a woman of grace and dignity, a power in London
drawing-rooms, and Haydn set songs of hers to music. But the
reserved Joanna was tempted to no light triumphs. Eight years later
was published her first volume of 'Plays on the Passions.' It
contained 'Basil,' a tragedy on love; 'The Trial,' a comedy on the
same subject; and 'De Montfort,' a tragedy on hatred.</p>
<p>The thought of essaying dramatic composition had burst upon the
author one summer afternoon as she sat sewing with her mother. She
had a high moral purpose in her plan of composition, she said in
her preface,--that purpose being the ultimate utterance of the
drama. Plot and incident she set little value upon, and she
rejected the presentation of the most splendid event if it did not
appertain to the development of the passion. In other words, what
is and was commonly of secondary consideration in the swift passage
of dramatic action became in her hands the stated and paramount
object. Feeling and passion are <i>not</i> precipitated by incident
in her drama as in real life. The play 'De Montfort' was presented
at Drury Lane Theatre in 1800; but in spite of every effort and the
acting of John Kemble and Mrs. Siddons, it had a run of but eleven
nights.</p>
<p>In 1802 Miss Baillie published her second volume of 'Plays on
the Passions.' It contained a comedy on hatred; 'Ethwald,' a
tragedy on ambition; and a comedy on ambition. Her adherence to her
old plan brought upon her an attack from Jeffrey in the Edinburgh
Review. He claimed that the complexity of the moral nature of man
made Joanna's theory false and absurd, that a play was too narrow
to show the complete growth of a passion, and that the end of the
drama is the entertainment of the audience. He asserted that she
imitated and plagiarized Shakespeare; while he admitted her insight
into human nature, her grasp of character, and her devotion to her
work.</p>
<p>About the time of the appearance of this volume, Joanna fixed
her residence with her mother and sister, among the lanes and
fields of Hampstead, where they continued throughout their lives.
The first volume of 'Miscellaneous Plays' came out in 1804. In the
preface she stated that her opinions set forth in her first preface
were unchanged. But the plays had a freer construction. "Miss
Baillie," wrote Jeffrey in his review, "cannot possibly write a
tragedy, or an act of a tragedy, without showing genius and
exemplifying a more dramatic conception and expression than any of
her modern competitor" 'Constantine Palaeologus,' which the volume
contained, had the liveliest commendation and popularity, and was
several times put upon the stage with spectacular effect.</p>
<p>In the year of the publication of Joanna's 'Miscellaneous
Plays,' Sir Walter Scott came to London, and seeking an
introduction through a common friend, made the way for a lifelong
friendship between the two, He had just brought out 'The Lay of the
Last Minstrel.' Miss Baillie was already a famous writer, with fast
friends in Lucy Aikin, Mary Berry, Mrs. Siddons, and other workers
in art and literature; but the hearty commendation of her
countryman, which she is said to have come upon unexpectedly when
reading 'Marmion' to a group of friends, she valued beyond other
praise. The legend is that she read through the passage firmly to
the close, and only lost self-control in her sympathy with the
emotion of a friend:--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i5">"--The wild harp that silent hung</p>
<p class="i1">By silver Avon's holy shore</p>
<p class="i1">Till twice one hundred years rolled o'er,</p>
<p class="i2">When she the bold enchantress came,</p>
<p class="i1">From the pale willow snatched the treasure,</p>
<p class="i2">With fearless hand and heart in flame,</p>
<p class="i1">And swept it with a kindred measure;</p>
<p class="i1">Till Avon's swans, while rung the grove</p>
<p class="i1">With Montfort's hate and Basil's love,</p>
<p class="i1">Awakening at the inspired strain,</p>
<p class="i1">Deemed their own Shakespeare lived again."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The year 1810 saw 'The Family Legend,' a play founded on a
tragic history of the Campbell clan. Scott wrote a prologue and
brought out the play in the Edinburgh Theatre. "You have only to
imagine," he told the author, "all that you could wish to give
success to a play, and your conceptions will still fall short of
the complete and decided triumph of 'The Family Legend.'"</p>
<p>The attacks which Jeffrey had made upon her verse were continued
when she published, in 1812, her third volume of 'Plays on the
Passions.' His voice, however, did not diminish the admiration for
the character-drawing with which the book was greeted, or for the
lyric outbursts occurring now and then in the dramas.</p>
<p>Joanna's quiet Hampstead life was broken in 1813 by a genial
meeting in London with the ambitious Madame de Sta&euml;l, and
again with the vivacious little Irishwoman, Maria Edgeworth. She
was keeping her promise of not writing more; but during a visit to
Sir Walter in 1820 her imagination was touched by Scotch tales, and
she published 'Metrical Legends' the following year. In this vast
Abbotsford she finally consented to meet Jeffrey. The plucky little
writer and the unshrinking critic at once became friends, and
thenceforward Jeffrey never went to London without visiting her in
Hampstead.</p>
<p>Her moral courage throughout life recalls the physical courage
which characterized her youth. She never concealed her religious
convictions, and in 1831 she published her ideas in 'A View of the
General Tenor of the New Testament Regarding the Nature and Dignity
of Jesus Christ.' In 1836, having finally given up the long hope of
seeing her plays become popular upon the stage, she prepared a
complete edition of her dramas with the addition of three plays
never before made public,--'Romiero,' a tragedy, 'The Alienated
Manor,' a comedy on jealousy, and 'Henriquez,' a tragedy on
remorse. The Edinburgh Review immediately put forth a eulogistic
notice of the collected edition, and at last admitted that the
reviewer had changed his judgment, and esteemed the author as a
dramatist above Byron and Scott.</p>
<p>"May God support both you and me, and give us comfort and
consolation when it is most wanted," wrote Miss Baillie to Mary
Berry in 1837. "As for myself, I do not wish to be one year younger
than I am; and have no desire, were it possible, to begin life
again, even under the most honorable circumstances. I have great
cause for humble thankfulness, and I am thankful."</p>
<p>In 1840 Jeffrey wrote:--"I have been twice out to Hampstead, and
found Joanna Baillie as fresh, natural, and amiable as ever, and as
little like a tragic muse." And again in 1842:--"She is marvelous
in health and spirit; not a bit deaf, blind, or torpid." About this
time she published her last book, a volume of 'Fugitive
Verses.'</p>
<p>"A sweeter picture of old age was never seen," wrote Harriet
Martineau. "Her figure was small, light, and active; her
countenance, in its expression of serenity, harmonized wonderfully
with her gay conversation and her cheerful voice. Her eyes were
beautiful, dark, bright, and penetrating, with the full innocent
gaze of childhood. Her face was altogether comely, and her dress
did justice to it. She wore her own silvery hair and a mob cap,
with its delicate lace border fitting close around her face. She
was well dressed, in handsome dark silks, and her lace caps and
collars looked always new. No Quaker was ever neater, while she
kept up with the times in her dress as in her habit of mind, as far
as became her years. In her whole appearance there was always
something for even the passing stranger to admire, and never
anything for the most familiar friend to wish otherwise." She died,
"without suffering, in the full possession of her faculties," in
her ninetieth year, 1851.</p>
<p>Her dramatic and poetical works are collected in one volume
(1843). Her Life, with selections from her songs, may be found in
'The Songstress of Scotland,' by Sarah Tytler and J.L. Watson
(1871).</p>

<h2>HENRY MARTYN <a name="BAIRD"></a>BAIRD</h2>
<h3>(1832-)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>hat stirring period of the history of France which in certain of
its features has been made so familiar by Dumas through the 'Three
Musketeers' series and others of his fascinating novels, is that
which has been the theme of Dr. Baird in the substantial work to
which so many years of his life have been devoted. It is to the
elucidation of one portion only of the history of this period that
he has given himself; but although in this, the story of the
Huguenots, nominally only a matter of religious belief was
involved, it in fact embraced almost the entire internal politics
of the nation, and the struggles for supremacy of its ambitious
families, as well as the effort to achieve religious freedom.</p>
<p class="lft"><img src="images/image327.png" width="40%" alt=
""><br>
<b>HENRY M. BAIRD</b></p>
<p>In these separate but related works the incidents of the whole
Protestant movement have been treated. The first of these, 'The
History of the Rise of the Huguenots in France' (1879), carries the
story to the time of Henry of Valois (1574), covering the massacre
of St. Bartholomew; the second, 'The Huguenots and Henry of
Navarre' (1886), covers the Protestant ascendancy and the Edict of
Nantes, and ends with the assassination of Henry in 1610; and the
third, 'The Huguenots and the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes'
(1895), completes the main story, and indeed brings the narrative
down to a date much later than the title seems to imply.</p>
<p>It may be said, perhaps, that Dr. Baird holds a brief for the
plaintiff in the case; but his work does not produce the impression
of being that of a violently prejudiced, although an interested,
writer. He is cool and careful, writing with precision, and
avoiding even the effects which the historian may reasonably feel
himself entitled to produce, and of which the period naturally
offers so many.</p>
<p>Henry Martyn Baird was born in Philadelphia, January 17th, 1832,
and was educated at the University of the City of New York and the
University of Athens, and at Union and Princeton Theological
Seminaries. In 1855 he became a tutor at Princeton; and in the
following year he published an interesting volume on 'Modern
Greece, a Narrative of Residence and Travel.' In 1859 he was
appointed to the chair of Greek Language and Literature in the
University of the City of New York.</p>
<p>In addition to the works heretofore named, he is the author of a
biography of his father, Robert Baird, D.D.</p>

<h3>THE BATTLE OF IVRY</h3>
<center>From 'The Huguenots and Henry of Navarre': by Charles
Scribner's Sons.</center>
<p>The battle began with a furious cannonade from the King's
artillery, so prompt that nine rounds of shot had been fired before
the enemy were ready to reply, so well directed that great havoc
was made in the opposing lines. Next, the light horse of M. de
Rosne, upon the extreme right of the Leaguers, made a dash upon
Marshal d'Aumont, but were valiantly received. Their example was
followed by the German reiters, who threw themselves upon the
defenders of the King's artillery and upon the light horse of
Aumont, who came to their relief; then, after their customary
fashion, wheeled around, expecting to pass easily through the gaps
between the friendly corps of Mayenne and Egmont, and to reload
their firearms at their leisure in the rear, by way of preparation
for a second charge.</p>
<p>Owing to the blunder of Tavannes, however, they met a serried
line of horse where they looked for an open field; and the Walloon
cavalry found themselves compelled to set their lances in
threatening position to ward off the dangerous onset of their
retreating allies. Another charge, made by a squadron of the
Walloon lancers themselves, was bravely met by Baron Biron. His
example was imitated by the Duke of Montpensier farther down the
field. Although the one leader was twice wounded, and the other had
his horse killed under him, both ultimately succeeded in repulsing
the enemy.</p>
<p>It was about this time that the main body of Henry's horse
became engaged with the gallant array of cavalry in their front.
Mayenne had placed upon the left of his squadron a body of four
hundred mounted carabineers. These, advancing first, rode rapidly
toward the King's line, took aim, and discharged their weapons with
deadly effect within twenty-five paces. Immediately afterward the
main force of eighteen hundred lancers presented themselves. The
King had fastened a great white plume to his helmet, and had
adorned his horse's head with another, equally conspicuous.
"Comrades!" he now exclaimed to those about him, "Comrades! God is
for us! There are his enemies and ours! If you lose sight of your
standards, rally to my white plume; you will find it on the road to
victory and to honor." The Huguenots had knelt after their fashion;
again Gabriel d'Amours had offered for them a prayer to the God of
battles: but no Joyeuse dreamed of suspecting that they were
meditating surrender or flight. The King, with the brave Huguenot
minister's prediction of victory still ringing in his ears, plunged
into the thickest of the fight, two horses' length ahead of his
companions. That moment he forgot that he was King of France and
general-in-chief, both in one, and fought as if he were a private
soldier. It was indeed a bold venture. True, the enemy, partly
because of the confusion induced by the reiters, partly from the
rapidity of the King's movements, had lost in some measure the
advantage they should have derived from their lances, and were
compelled to rely mainly upon their swords, as against the firearms
of their opponents. Still, they outnumbered the knights of the
King's squadron more than as two to one. No wonder that some of the
latter flinched and actually turned back; especially when the
standard-bearer of the King, receiving a deadly wound in the face,
lost control of his horse, and went riding aimlessly about the
field, still grasping the banner in grim desperation. But the
greater number emulated the courage of their leader. The white
plume kept them in the road to victory and to honor. Yet even this
beacon seemed at one moment to fail them. Another cavalier, who had
ostentatiously decorated his helmet much after the same fashion as
the King, was slain in the hand-to-hand conflict, and some, both of
the Huguenots and of their enemies, for a time supposed the great
Protestant champion himself to have fallen.</p>
<p>But although fiercely contested, the conflict was not long. The
troopers of Mayenne wavered, and finally fled. Henry of Navarre
emerged from the confusion, to the great relief of his anxious
followers, safe and sound, covered with dust and blood not his own.
More than once he had been in great personal peril. On his return
from the mel&eacute;e, he halted, with a handful of companions,
under the pear-trees indicated beforehand as a rallying-point, when
he was descried and attacked by three bands of Walloon horse that
had not yet engaged in the fight. Only his own valor and the timely
arrival of some of his troops saved the imprudent monarch from
death or captivity.</p>
<p>The rout of Mayenne's principal corps was quickly followed by
the disintegration of his entire army. The Swiss auxiliaries of the
League, though compelled to surrender their flags, were, as ancient
allies of the crown, admitted to honorable terms of capitulation.
To the French, who fell into the King's hands, he was equally
clement. Indeed, he spared no efforts to save their lives. But it
was otherwise with the German lansquenets. Their treachery at
Arques, where they had pretended to come over to the royal side
only to turn upon those who had believed their protestations and
welcomed them to their ranks, was yet fresh in the memory of all.
They received no mercy at the King's hands.</p>
<p>Gathering his available forces together, and strengthened by the
accession of old Marshal Biron, who had been compelled, much
against his will, to remain a passive spectator while others
fought, Henry pursued the remnants of the army of the League many a
mile to Mantes and the banks of the Seine. If their defeat by a
greatly inferior force had been little to the credit of either the
generals or the troops of the League, their precipitate flight was
still less decorous. The much-vaunted Flemish lancers distinguished
themselves, it was said, by not pausing until they found safety
beyond the borders of France; and Mayenne, never renowned for
courage, emulated or surpassed them in the eagerness he displayed,
on reaching the little town from which the battle took its name, to
put as many leagues as possible between himself and his pursuers.
"The enemy thus ran away," says the Englishman William Lyly, who
was an eye-witness of the battle; "Mayenne to Ivry, where the
Walloons and reiters followed so fast that there standing, hasting
to draw breath, and not able to speak, he was constrained to draw
his sword to strike the flyers to make place for his own
flight."</p>
<p>The battle had been a short one. Between ten and eleven o'clock
the first attack was made; in less than an hour the army of the
League was routed. It had been a glorious action for the King and
his old Huguenots, and not less for the loyal Roman Catholics who
clung to him. None seemed discontented but old Marshal Biron, who,
when he met the King coming out of the fray with battered armor and
blunted sword, could not help contrasting the opportunity his
Majesty had enjoyed to distinguish himself with his own enforced
inactivity, and exclaimed, "Sire, this is not right! You have
to-day done what Biron ought to have done, and he has done what the
King should have done." But even Biron was unable to deny that the
success of the royal arms surpassed all expectation, and deserved
to rank among the wonders of history. The preponderance of the
enemy in numbers had been great. There was no question that the
impetuous attacks of their cavalry upon the left wing of the King
were for a time almost successful. The official accounts might
conveniently be silent upon the point, but the truth could not be
disguised that at the moment Henry plunged into battle a part of
his line was grievously shaken, a part was in full retreat, and the
prospect was dark enough. Some of his immediate followers, indeed,
at this time turned countenance and were disposed to flee,
whereupon he recalled them to their duty with the words, "Look this
way, in order that if you will not fight, at least you may see me
die." But the steady and determined courage of the King, well
seconded by soldiers not less brave, turned the tide of battle.
"The enemy took flight," says the devout Duplessis Mornay,
"terrified rather by God than by men; for it is certain that the
one side was not less shaken than the other." And with the flight
of the cavalry, Mayenne's infantry, constituting, as has been seen,
three-fourths of his entire army, gave up the day as lost, without
striking a blow for the cause they had come to support. How many
men the army of the League lost in killed and wounded it is
difficult to say. The Prince of Parma reported to his master the
loss of two hundred and seventy of the Flemish lancers, together
with their commander, the Count of Egmont. The historian De Thou
estimates the entire number of deaths on the side of the League,
including the combatants that fell in the battle and the fugitives
drowned at the crossing of the river Eure, by Ivry, at eight
hundred. The official account, on the other hand, agrees with
Marshal Biron, in stating that of the cavalry alone more than
fifteen hundred died, and adds that four hundred were taken
prisoners; while Davila swells the total of the slain to the
incredible sum of upward of six thousand men.</p>

<p>he Northwest Passage, the Pole itself, and the sources of the
Nile--how many have struggled through ice and snow, or burned
themselves with tropic heat, in the effort to penetrate these
secrets of the earth! And how many have left their bones to whiten
on the desert or lie hidden beneath icebergs at the end of the
search!</p>

<b>SIR SAMUEL BAKER</b></p>
<p>Of the fortunate ones who escaped after many perils, Baker was
one of the most fortunate. He explored the Blue and the White Nile,
discovered at least one of the reservoirs from which flows the
great river of Egypt, and lived to tell the tale and to receive due
honor, being knighted by the Queen therefor, f&ecirc;ted by learned
societies, and sent subsequently by the Khedive at the head of a
large force with commission to destroy the slave trade. In this he
appears to have been successful for a time, but for a time
only.</p>
<p>Baker was born in London, June 8th, 1821, and died December
30th, 1893. With his brother he established, in 1847, a settlement
in the mountains of Ceylon, where he spent several years. His
experiences in the far East appear in books entitled 'The Rifle and
Hound in Ceylon' and 'Eight Years Wandering in Ceylon.' In 1861,
accompanied by his young wife and an escort, he started up the
Nile, and three years later, on the 14th of March, 1864, at length
reached the cliffs overlooking the Albert Nyanza, being the first
European to behold its waters. Like most Englishmen, he was an
enthusiastic sportsman, and his manner of life afforded him a great
variety of unusual experiences. He visited Cyprus in 1879, after
the execution of the convention between England and Turkey, and
subsequently he traveled to Syria, India, Japan, and America. He
kept voluminous notes of his various journeys, which he utilized in
the preparation of numerous volumes:--'The Albert Nyanza'; 'The
Nile Tributaries of Abyssinia'; 'Ism&auml;ilia,' a narrative of the
expedition under the auspices of the Khedive; 'Cyprus as I Saw It
in 1879'; together with 'Wild Beasts and Their Ways,' 'True Tales
for My Grandsons,' and a story entitled 'Cast Up by the Sea,' which
was for many years a great favorite with the boys of England and
America. They are all full of life and incident. One of the most
delightful memories of them which readers retain is the figure of
his lovely wife, so full of courage, loyalty, buoyancy, and charm.
He had that rarest of possibilities, spirit-stirring adventure and
home companionship at once.</p>

<h3>HUNTING IN ABYSSINIA</h3>
<center>From 'The Nile Tributaries of Abyssinia'</center>
<p>On arrival at the camp, I resolved to fire the entire country on
the following day, and to push still farther up the course of the
Settite to the foot of the mountains, and to return to this camp in
about a fortnight, by which time the animals that had been scared
away by the fire would have returned. Accordingly, on the following
morning, accompanied by a few of the aggageers, I started upon the
south bank of the river, and rode for some distance into the
interior, to the ground that was entirely covered with high
withered grass. We were passing through a mass of kittar thorn
bush, almost hidden by the immensely high grass, when, as I was
ahead of the party, I came suddenly upon the tracks of rhinoceros;
these were so unmistakably recent that I felt sure we were not far
from the animals themselves. As I had wished to fire the grass, I
was accompanied by my Tokrooris, and my horse-keeper, Mahomet No.
2. It was difficult ground for the men, and still more unfavorable
for the horses, as large disjointed masses of stone were concealed
in the high grass.</p>
<p>We were just speculating as to the position of the rhinoceros,
and thinking how uncommonly unpleasant it would be should he obtain
our wind, when whiff! whiff! whiff! We heard the sharp whistling
snort, with a tremendous rush through the high grass and thorns
close to us; and at the same moment two of these determined brutes
were upon us in full charge. I never saw such a scrimmage; <i>sauve
qui peut</i>! There was no time for more than one look behind. I
dug the spurs into Aggahr's flanks, and clasping him round the
neck, I ducked my head down to his shoulder, well protected with my
strong hunting cap, and I kept the spurs going as hard as I could
ply them, blindly trusting to Providence and my good horse, over
big rocks, fallen trees, thick kittar thorns, and grass ten feet
high, with the two infernal animals in full chase only a few feet
behind me. I heard their abominable whiffing close to me, but so
did my horse also, and the good old hunter flew over obstacles that
I should have thought impossible, and he dashed straight under the
hooked thorn bushes and doubled like a hare. The aggageers were all
scattered; Mahomet No. 2 was knocked over by a rhinoceros; all the
men were sprawling upon the rocks with their guns, and the party
was entirely discomfited. Having passed the kittar thorn, I turned,
and seeing that the beasts had gone straight on, I brought Aggahr's
head round, and tried to give chase, but it was perfectly
impossible; it was only a wonder that the horse had escaped in
ground so difficult for riding. Although my clothes were of the
strongest and coarsest Arab cotton cloth, which seldom tore, but
simply lost a thread when caught in a thorn, I was nearly naked. My
blouse was reduced to shreds; as I wore sleeves only half way from
the shoulder to the elbow, my naked arms were streaming with blood;
fortunately my hunting cap was secured with a chin strap, and still
more fortunately I had grasped the horse's neck, otherwise I must
have been dragged out of the saddle by the hooked thorns. All the
men were cut and bruised, some having fallen upon their heads among
the rocks, and others had hurt their legs in falling in their
endeavors to escape. Mahomet. No. 2, the horse-keeper, was more
frightened than hurt, as he had been knocked down by the shoulder,
and not by the horn of the rhinoceros, as the animal had not
noticed him: its attention was absorbed by the horse.</p>
<p>I determined to set fire to the whole country immediately, and
descending the hill toward the river to obtain a favorable wind, I
put my men in a line, extending over about a mile along the river's
bed, and they fired the grass in different places. With a loud
roar, the flame leaped high in air and rushed forward with
astonishing velocity; the grass was as inflammable as tinder, and
the strong north wind drove the long line of fire spreading in
every direction through the country.</p>
<p>We now crossed to the other side of the river to avoid the
flames, and we returned toward the camp. On the way I made a long
shot and badly wounded a t&eacute;tel, but lost it in thick thorns;
shortly after, I stalked a nellut <i>(A. Strepsiceros</i>), and
bagged it with the Fletcher rifle.</p>
<p>We arrived early in camp, and on the following day we moved
sixteen miles farther up stream, and camped under a tamarind-tree
by the side of the river. No European had ever been farther than
our last camp, Delladilla, and that spot had only been visited by
Johann Schmidt and Florian. In the previous year, my aggageers had
sabred some of the Bas&eacute; at this very camping-place; they
accordingly requested me to keep a vigilant watch during the night,
as they would be very likely to attack us in revenge, unless they
had been scared by the rifles and by the size of our party. They
advised me not to remain long in this spot, as it would be very
dangerous for my wife to be left almost alone during the day, when
we were hunting, and that the Bas&eacute; would be certain to espy
us from the mountains, and would most probably attack and carry her
off when they were assured of our departure. She was not very
nervous about this, but she immediately called the dragoman,
Mahomet, who knew the use of a gun, and she asked him if he would
stand by her in case they were attacked in my absence; the faithful
servant replied, "Mahomet fight the Bas&eacute;? No, Missus;
Mahomet not fight; if the Bas&eacute; come, Missus fight; Mahomet
run away; Mahomet not come all the way from Cairo to get him killed
by black fellers; Mahomet will run--Inshallah!" (Please God.)</p>
<p>This frank avowal of his military tactics was very reassuring.
There was a high hill of basalt, something resembling a pyramid,
within a quarter of a mile of us; I accordingly ordered some of my
men every day to ascend this look-out station, and I resolved to
burn the high grass at once, so as to destroy all cover for the
concealment of an enemy. That evening I very nearly burned our
camp; I had several times ordered the men to clear away the dry
grass for about thirty yards from our resting-place; this they had
neglected to obey. We had been joined a few days before by a party
of about a dozen Hamran Arabs, who were hippopotami hunters; thus
we mustered very strong, and it would have been the work of about
half an hour to have cleared away the grass as I had desired.</p>
<p>The wind was brisk, and blew directly toward our camp, which was
backed by the river. I accordingly took a fire-stick, and I told my
people to look sharp, as they would not clear away the grass. I
walked to the foot of the basalt hill, and fired the grass in
several places. In an instant the wind swept the flame and smoke
toward the camp. All was confusion; the Arabs had piled the
camel-saddles and all their corn and effects in the high grass
about twenty yards from the tent; there was no time to remove all
these things; therefore, unless they could clear away the grass so
as to stop the fire before it should reach the spot, they would be
punished for their laziness by losing their property. The fire
traveled quicker than I had expected, and, by the time I had
hastened to the tent, I found the entire party working frantically;
the Arabs were slashing down the grass with their swords, and
sweeping it away with their shields, while my Tokrooris were
beating it down with long sticks and tearing it from its withered
and fortunately tinder-rotten roots, in desperate haste. The flames
rushed on, and we already felt the heat, as volumes of smoke
enveloped us; I thought it advisable to carry the gunpowder (about
20 lbs.) down to the river, together with the rifles; while my wife
and Mahomet dragged the various articles of luggage to the same
place of safety. The fire now approached within about sixty yards,
and dragging out the iron pins, I let the tent fall to the ground.
The Arabs had swept a line like a high-road perfectly clean, and
they were still tearing away the grass, when they were suddenly
obliged to rush back as the flames arrived.</p>
<p>Almost instantaneously the smoke blew over us, but the fire had
expired upon meeting the cleared ground. I now gave them a little
lecture upon obedience to orders; and from that day, their first
act upon halting for the night was to clear away the grass, lest I
should repeat the entertainment. In countries that are covered with
dry grass, it should be an invariable rule to clear the ground
around the camp before night; hostile natives will frequently fire
the grass to windward of a party, or careless servants may leave
their pipes upon the ground, which fanned by the wind would quickly
create a blaze. That night the mountain afforded a beautiful
appearance as the flames ascended the steep sides, and ran
flickering up the deep gullies with a brilliant light.</p>
<p>We were standing outside the tent admiring the scene, which
perfectly illuminated the neighborhood, when suddenly an apparition
of a lion and lioness stood for an instant before us at about
fifteen yards distance, and then disappeared over the blackened
ground before I had time to snatch a rifle from the tent. No doubt
they had been disturbed from the mountain by the fire, and had
mistaken their way in the country so recently changed from high
grass to black ashes. In this locality I considered it advisable to
keep a vigilant watch during the night, and the Arabs were told off
for that purpose.</p>
<p>A little before sunrise I accompanied the howartis, or
hippopotamus hunters, for a day's sport. There were numbers of
hippos in this part of the river, and we were not long before we
found a herd. The hunters failed in several attempts to harpoon
them, but they succeeded in stalking a crocodile after a most
peculiar fashion. This large beast was lying upon a sandbank on the
opposite margin of the river, close to a bed of rushes.</p>
<p>The howartis, having studied the wind, ascended for about a
quarter of a mile, and then swam across the river, harpoon in hand.
The two men reached the opposite bank, beneath which they
alternately waded or swam down the stream toward the spot upon
which the crocodile was lying. Thus advancing under cover of the
steep bank, or floating with the stream in deep places, and
crawling like crocodiles across the shallows, the two hunters at
length arrived at the bank or rushes, on the other side of which
the monster was basking asleep upon the sand. They were now about
waist-deep, and they kept close to the rushes with their harpoons
raised, ready to cast the moment they should pass the rush bed and
come in view of the crocodile. Thus steadily advancing, they had
just arrived at the corner within about eight yards of the
crocodile, when the creature either saw them, or obtained their
wind; in an instant it rushed to the water; at the same moment, the
two harpoons were launched with great rapidity by the hunters. One
glanced obliquely from the scales; the other stuck fairly in the
tough hide, and the iron, detached from the bamboo, held fast,
while the ambatch float, running on the surface of the water,
marked the course of the reptile beneath.</p>
<p>The hunters chose a convenient place, and recrossed the stream
to our side, apparently not heeding the crocodiles more than we
should pike when bathing in England. They would not waste their
time by securing the crocodile at present, as they wished to kill a
hippopotamus; the float would mark the position, and they would be
certain to find it later. We accordingly continued our search for
hippopotami; these animals appeared to be on the <i>qui vive</i>,
and, as the hunters once more failed in an attempt, I made a clean
shot behind the ear of one, and killed it dead. At length we
arrived at a large pool, in which were several sandbanks covered
with rushes, and many rocky islands. Among these rocks were a herd
of hippopotami, consisting of an old bull and several cows; a young
hippo was standing, like an ugly little statue, on a protruding
rock, while another infant stood upon its mother's back that
listlessly floated on the water.</p>
<p>This was an admirable place for the hunters. They desired me to
lie down, and they crept into the jungle out of view of the river;
I presently observed them stealthily descending the dry bed about
two hundred paces above the spot where the hippos were basking
behind the rocks. They entered the river, and swam down the centre
of the stream toward the rock. This was highly exciting:--the
hippos were quite unconscious of the approaching danger, as,
steadily and rapidly, the hunters floated down the strong current;
they neared the rock, and both heads disappeared as they purposely
sank out of view; in a few seconds later they reappeared at the
edge of the rock upon which the young hippo stood. It would be
difficult to say which started first, the astonished young hippo
into the water, or the harpoons from the hands of the howartis! It
was the affair of a moment; the hunters dived directly they had
hurled their harpoons, and, swimming for some distance under water,
they came to the surface, and hastened to the shore lest an
infuriated hippopotamus should follow them. One harpoon had missed;
the other had fixed the bull of the herd, at which it had been
surely aimed. This was grand sport! The bull was in the greatest
fury, and rose to the surface, snorting and blowing in his impotent
rage; but as the ambatch float was exceedingly large, and this
naturally accompanied his movements, he tried to escape from his
imaginary persecutor, and dived constantly, only to find his
pertinacious attendant close to him upon regaining the surface.
This was not to last long; the howartis were in earnest, and they
at once called their party, who, with two of the aggageers, Abou Do
and Suleiman, were near at hand; these men arrived with the long
ropes that form a portion of the outfit for hippo hunting.</p>
<p>The whole party now halted on the edge of the river, while two
men swam across with one end of the long rope. Upon gaining the
opposite bank, I observed that a second rope was made fast to the
middle of the main line; thus upon our side we held the ends of two
ropes, while on the opposite side they had only one; accordingly,
the point of junction of the two ropes in the centre formed an
acute angle. The object of this was soon practically explained. Two
men upon our side now each held a rope, and one of these walked
about ten yards before the other. Upon both sides of the river the
people now advanced, dragging the rope on the surface of the water
until they reached the ambatch float that was swimming to and fro,
according to the movements of the hippopotamus below. By a
dexterous jerk of the main line, the float was now placed between
the two ropes, and it was immediately secured in the acute angle by
bringing together the ends of these ropes on our side.</p>
<p>The men on the opposite bank now dropped their line, and our men
hauled in upon the ambatch float that was held fast between the
ropes. Thus cleverly made sure, we quickly brought a strain upon
the hippo, and, although I have had some experience in handling big
fish, I never knew one pull so lustily as the amphibious animal
that we now alternately coaxed and bullied. He sprang out of the
water, gnashed his huge jaws, snorted with tremendous rage, and
lashed the river into foam; he then dived, and foolishly approached
us beneath the water. We quickly gathered in the slack line, and
took a round turn upon a large rock, within a few feet of the
river. The hippo now rose to the surface, about ten yards from the
hunters, and, jumping half out of the water, he snapped his great
jaws together, endeavoring to catch the rope, but at the same
instant two harpoons were launched into his side. Disdaining
retreat and maddened with rage, the furious animal charged from the
depths of the river, and, gaining a footing, he reared his bulky
form from the surface, came boldly upon the sandbank, and attacked
the hunters open-mouthed. He little knew his enemy; they were not
the men to fear a pair of gaping jaws, armed with a deadly array of
tusks, but half a dozen lances were hurled at him, some entering
his mouth from a distance of five or six paces, at the same time
several men threw handfuls of sand into his enormous eyes. This
baffled him more than the lances; he crunched the shafts between
his powerful jaws like straws, but he was beaten by the sand, and,
shaking his huge head, he retreated to the river. During his sally
upon the shore, two of the hunters had secured the ropes of the
harpoons that had been fastened in his body just before his charge;
he was now fixed by three of these deadly instruments, but suddenly
one rope gave way, having been bitten through by the enraged beast,
who was still beneath the water. Immediately after this he appeared
on the surface, and, without a moment's hesitation, he once more
charged furiously from the water straight at the hunters, with his
huge mouth open to such an extent that he could have accommodated
two inside passengers. Suleiman was wild with delight, and
springing forward lance in hand, he drove it against the head of
the formidable animal, but without effect. At the same time, Abou
Do met the hippo sword in hand, reminding me of Perseus slaying the
sea-monster that would devour Andromeda, but the sword made a
harmless gash, and the lance, already blunted against the rocks,
refused to penetrate the tough hide; once more handfuls of sand
were pelted upon his face, and again repulsed by this blinding
attack, he was forced to retire to his deep hole and wash it from
his eyes. Six times during the fight the valiant bull hippo quitted
his watery fortress, and charged resolutely at his pursuers; he had
broken several of their lances in his jaws, other lances had been
hurled, and, falling upon the rocks, they were blunted, and would
not penetrate. The fight had continued for three hours, and the sun
was about to set, accordingly the hunters begged me to give him the
<i>coup de grace</i>, as they had hauled him close to the shore,
and they feared he would sever the rope with his teeth. I waited
for a good opportunity, when he boldly raised his head from water
about three yards from the rifle, and a bullet from the little
Fletcher between the eyes closed the last act.</p>

<h3>THE SOURCES OF THE NILE</h3>
<center>From 'The Albert Nyanza'</center>
<p>The name of this village was Parkani. For several days past our
guides had told us that we were very near to the lake, and we were
now assured that we should reach it on the morrow. I had noticed a
lofty range of mountains at an immense distance west, and I had
imagined that the lake lay on the other side of this chain; but I
was now informed that those mountains formed the western frontier
of the M'wootan N'zig&eacute;, and that the lake was actually
within a march of Parkani. I could not believe it possible that we
were so near the object of our search. The guide Rabonga now
appeared, and declared that if we started early on the following
morning we should be able to wash in the lake by noon!</p>
<p>That night I hardly slept. For years I had striven to reach the
"sources of the Nile." In my nightly dreams during that arduous
voyage I had always failed, but after so much hard work and
perseverance the cup was at my very lips, and I was to drink at the
mysterious fountain before another sun should set--at that great
reservoir of Nature that ever since creation had baffled all
discovery.</p>
<p>I had hoped, and prayed, and striven through all kinds of
difficulties, in sickness, starvation, and fatigue, to reach that
hidden source; and when it had appeared impossible, we had both
determined to die upon the road rather than return defeated. Was it
possible that it was so near, and that to-morrow we could say, "the
work is accomplished"?</p>
<p>The 14th March. The sun had not risen when I was spurring my ox
after the guide, who, having been promised a double handful of
beads on arrival at the lake, had caught the enthusiasm of the
moment. The day broke beautifully clear, and having crossed a deep
valley between the hills, we toiled up the opposite slope. I
hurried to the summit. The glory of our prize burst suddenly upon
me! There, like a sea of quicksilver, lay far beneath the grand
expanse of water,--a boundless sea horizon on the south and
southwest, glittering in the noonday sun; and on the west at fifty
or sixty miles distance blue mountains rose from the bosom of the
lake to a height of about 7,000 feet above its level.</p>
<p>It is impossible to describe the triumph of that moment;--here
was the reward for all our labor--for the years of tenacity with
which we had toiled through Africa. England had won the sources of
the Nile! Long before I reached this spot I had arranged to give
three cheers with all our men in English style in honor of the
discovery, but now that I looked down upon the great inland sea
lying nestled in the very heart of Africa, and thought how vainly
mankind had sought these sources throughout so many ages, and
reflected that I had been the humble instrument permitted to
unravel this portion of the great mystery when so many greater than
I had failed, I felt too serious to vent my feelings in vain cheers
for victory, and I sincerely thanked God for having guided and
supported us through all dangers to the good end. I was about 1,500
feet above the lake, and I looked down from the steep granite cliff
upon those welcome waters--upon that vast reservoir which nourished
Egypt and brought fertility where all was wilderness--upon that
great source so long hidden from mankind; that source of bounty and
of blessings to millions of human beings; and as one of the
greatest objects in nature, I determined to honor it with a great
name. As an imperishable memorial of one loved and mourned by our
gracious Queen and deplored by every Englishman, I called this
great lake "the Albert Nyanza." The Victoria and the Albert lakes
are the two sources of the Nile.</p>

<h3>(1848-)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-a.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>lthough the prominence of Arthur James Balfour in English
contemporary life is in the main that of a statesman, he has a high
place as a critic of philosophy, especially in its relation to
religion. During the early part of his life his interests were
entirely those of a student. He was born in 1848, a member of the
Cecil family, and a nephew of the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury.
His tastes were those of a retired thinker. He cared for
literature, music, and philosophy, but very little for the
political world; so little that he never read the newspapers. This
tendency was increased by his delicate health. When, therefore, as
a young man in the neighborhood of thirty, he was made Secretary
for Scotland, people laughed. His uncle's choice proved to be a
wise one, however; and he later, in 1886, gave his nephew the very
important position of Irish Secretary, at a time when some of the
ablest and most experienced statesmen had failed. Mr. Balfour won
an unexpected success and a wide reputation, and from that time on
he developed rapidly into one of the most skillful statesmen of the
Conservative party. By tradition and by temperament he is an
extreme Tory; and it is in the opposition, as a skillful fencer in
debate and a sharp critic of pretentious schemes, that he has been
most admired and most feared. However, he is kept from being
narrowly confined to the traditional point of view by the
philosophic interests and training of his mind, which he has turned
into practical fairness. Some of his speeches are most original in
suggestion, and all show a literary quality of a high order. His
writings on other subjects are also broad, scholarly, and
practical. 'A Defense of Philosophic Doubt' is thought by some
philosophers to be the ablest work of destructive criticism since
Hume. 'The Foundations of Belief' covers somewhat the same ground
and in more popular fashion. 'Essays and Addresses' is a collection
of papers on literature and sociology.</p>

<h3>THE PLEASURES OF READING</h3>
<center>From his Rectorial Address before the University of
Glasgow</center>
<p>I confess to have been much perplexed in my search for a topic
on which I could say something to which you would have patience to
listen, or on which I might find it profitable to speak. One theme
however there is, not inappropriate to the place in which I stand,
nor I hope unwelcome to the audience which I address. The youngest
of you have left behind that period of youth during which it seems
inconceivable that any book should afford recreation except a
story-book. Many of you are just reaching the period when, at the
end of your prescribed curriculum, the whole field and compass of
literature lies outspread before you; when, with faculties trained
and disciplined, and the edge of curiosity not dulled or worn with
use, you may enter at your leisure into the intellectual heritage
of the centuries.</p>
<p>Now the question of how to read and what to read has of late
filled much space in the daily papers, if it cannot strictly
speaking be said to have profoundly occupied the public mind. But
you need be under no alarm. I am not going to supply you with a new
list of the hundred books most worth reading, nor am I about to
take the world into my confidence in respect of my "favorite
passages from the best authors." Nor again do I address myself to
the professed student, to the fortunate individual with whom
literature or science is the business as well as the pleasure of
life. I have not the qualifications which would enable me to
undertake such a task with the smallest hope of success. My theme
is humble, though the audience to whom I desire to speak is large:
for I speak to the ordinary reader with ordinary capacities and
ordinary leisure, to whom reading is, or ought to be, not a
business but a pleasure; and my theme is the enjoyment--not, mark
you, the improvement, nor the glory, nor the profit, but the
<i>enjoyment</i>--which may be derived by such an one from
books.</p>
<p>It is perhaps due to the controversial habits engendered by my
unfortunate profession, that I find no easier method of making my
own view clear than that of contrasting with it what I regard as an
erroneous view held by somebody else; and in the present case the
doctrine which I shall choose as a foil to my own, is one which has
been stated with the utmost force and directness by that brilliant
and distinguished writer, Mr. Frederic Harrison. He has, as many of
you know, recently given us, in a series of excellent essays, his
opinion on the principles which should guide us in the choice of
books. Against that part of his treatise which is occupied with
specific recommendations of certain authors I have not a word to
say. He has resisted all the temptations to eccentricity which so
easily beset the modern critic. Every book which he praises
deserves his praise, and has long been praised by the world at
large. I do not, indeed, hold that the verdict of the world is
necessarily binding on the individual conscience. I admit to the
full that there is an enormous quantity of hollow devotion, of
withered orthodoxy divorced from living faith, in the eternal
chorus of praise which goes up from every literary altar to the
memory of the immortal dead. Nevertheless every critic is bound to
recognize, as Mr. Harrison recognizes, that he must put down to
individual peculiarity any difference he may have with the general
verdict of the ages; he must feel that mankind are not likely to be
in a conspiracy of error as to the kind of literary work which
conveys to them the highest literary enjoyment, and that in such
cases at least <i>securus judicat orbis terrarum</i>.</p>
<p>But it is quite possible to hold that any work recommended by
Mr. Harrison is worth repeated reading, and yet to reject utterly
the theory of study by which these recommendations are prefaced.
For Mr. Harrison is a ruthless censor. His <i>index
expurgatorius</i> includes, so far as I can discover, the whole
catalogue of the British Museum, with the exception of a small
remnant which might easily be contained in about thirty or forty
volumes. The vast remainder he contemplates with feelings
apparently not merely of indifference, but of active aversion. He
surveys the boundless and ever-increasing waste of books with
emotions compounded of disgust and dismay. He is almost tempted to
say in his haste that the invention of printing has been an evil
one for humanity. In the habits of miscellaneous reading, born of a
too easy access to libraries, circulating and other, he sees many
soul-destroying tendencies; and his ideal reader would appear to be
a gentleman who rejects with a lofty scorn all in history that does
not pass for being first-rate in importance, and all in literature
that is not admitted to be first-rate in quality.</p>
<p>Now, I am far from denying that this theory is plausible. Of all
that has been written, it is certain that the professed student can
master but an infinitesimal fraction. Of that fraction the ordinary
reader can master but a very small part. What advice, then, can be
better than to select for study the few masterpieces that have come
down to us, and to treat as non-existent the huge but
undistinguished remainder? We are like travelers passing hastily
through some ancient city; filled with memorials of many
generations and more than one great civilization. Our time is
short. Of what may be seen we can only see at best but a trifling
fragment. Let us then take care that we waste none of our precious
moments upon that which is less than the most excellent. So
preaches Mr. Frederic Harrison; and when a doctrine which put thus
may seem not only wise but obvious, is further supported by such
assertions that habits of miscellaneous reading "close the mind to
what is spiritually sustaining" by "stuffing it with what is simply
curious," or that such methods of study are worse than no habits of
study at all because they "gorge and enfeeble" the mind by "excess
in that which cannot nourish," I almost feel that in venturing to
dissent from it, I may be attacking not merely the teaching of
common sense but the inspirations of a high morality.</p>
<p>Yet I am convinced that for most persons the views thus laid
down by Mr. Harrison are wrong; and that what he describes, with
characteristic vigor, as "an impotent voracity for desultory
information," is in reality a most desirable and a not too common
form of mental appetite. I have no sympathy whatever with the
horror he expresses at the "incessant accumulation of fresh books."
I am never tempted to regret that Gutenberg was born into the
world. I care not at all though the "cataract of printed stuff," as
Mr. Harrison calls it, should flow and still flow on until the
catalogues of our libraries should make libraries themselves. I am
prepared, indeed, to express sympathy almost amounting to
approbation for any one who would check all writing which was
<i>not</i> intended for the printer. I pay no tribute of grateful
admiration to those who have oppressed mankind with the dubious
blessing of the penny post. But the ground of the distinction is
plain. We are always obliged to read our letters, and are sometimes
obliged to answer them. But who obliges us to wade through the
piled-up lumber of an ancient library, or to skim more than we like
off the frothy foolishness poured forth in ceaseless streams by our
circulating libraries? Dead dunces do not importune us; Grub Street
does not ask for a reply by return of post. Even their living
successors need hurt no one who possesses the very moderate degree
of social courage required to make the admission that he has not
read the last new novel or the current number of a fashionable
magazine.</p>
<p>But this is not the view of Mr. Harrison. To him the position of
any one having free access to a large library is fraught with
issues so tremendous that, in order adequately to describe it, he
has to seek for parallels in two of the most highly-wrought
episodes in fiction: the Ancient Mariner, becalmed and thirsting on
the tropic ocean; Bunyan's Christian in the crisis of spiritual
conflict. But there is here, surely, some error and some
exaggeration. Has miscellaneous reading all the dreadful
consequences which Mr. Harrison depicts? Has it any of them? His
declaration about the intellect being "gorged and enfeebled" by the
absorption of too much information, expresses no doubt with great
vigor an analogy, for which there is high authority, between the
human mind and the human stomach; but surely it is an analogy which
may be pressed too far. I have often heard of the individual whose
excellent natural gifts have been so overloaded with huge masses of
undigested and indigestible learning that they have had no chance
of healthy development. But though I have often heard of this
personage, I have never met him, and I believe him to be mythical.
It is true, no doubt, that many learned people are dull; but there
is no indication whatever that they are dull because they are
learned. True dullness is seldom acquired; it is a natural grace,
the manifestations of which, however modified by education, remain
in substance the same. Fill a dull man to the brim with knowledge,
and he will not become less dull, as the enthusiasts for education
vainly imagine; but neither will he become duller, as Mr. Harrison
appears to suppose. He will remain in essence what he always has
been and always must have been. But whereas his dullness would, if
left to itself, have been merely vacuous, it may have become, under
cureful cultivation, pretentious and pedantic.</p>
<p>I would further point out to you that while there is no ground
in experience for supposing that a keen interest in those facts
which Mr. Harrison describes as "merely curious" has any stupefying
effect upon the mind, or has any tendency to render it insensible
to the higher things of literature and art, there is positive
evidence that many of those who have most deeply felt the charm of
these higher things have been consumed by that omnivorous appetite
for knowledge which excites Mr. Harrison's especial indignation.
Dr. Johnson, for instance, though deaf to some of the most delicate
harmonies of verse, was without question a very great critic. Yet
in Dr. Johnson's opinion, literary history, which is for the most
part composed of facts which Mr. Harrison would regard as
insignificant, about authors whom he would regard as pernicious,
was the most delightful of studies. Again, consider the case of
Lord Macaulay. Lord Macaulay did everything Mr. Harrison says he
ought not to have done. From youth to age he was continuously
occupied in "gorging and enfeebling" his intellect, by the
unlimited consumption of every species of literature, from the
masterpieces of the age of Pericles to the latest rubbish from the
circulating library. It is not told of him that his intellect
suffered by the process; and though it will hardly be claimed for
him that he was a great critic, none will deny that he possessed
the keenest susceptibilities for literary excellence in many
languages and in every form. If Englishmen and Scotchmen do not
satisfy you, I will take a Frenchman. The most accomplished critic
whom France has produced is, by general admission, Ste.-Beuve. His
capacity for appreciating supreme perfection in literature will be
disputed by none; yet the great bulk of his vast literary industry
was expended upon the lives and writings of authors whose lives Mr.
Harrison would desire us to forget, and whose writings almost wring
from him the wish that the art of printing had never been
discovered.</p>
<p>I am even bold enough to hazard the conjecture (I trust he will
forgive me) that Mr. Harrison's life may be quoted against Mr.
Harrison's theory. I entirely decline to believe, without further
evidence, that the writings whose vigor of style and of thought
have been the delight of us all are the product of his own system.
I hope I do him no wrong, but I cannot help thinking that if we
knew the truth, we should find that he followed the practice of
those worthy physicians who, after prescribing the most abstemious
diet to their patients, may be seen partaking freely, and to all
appearances safely, of the most succulent and the most unwholesome
of the forbidden dishes.</p>
<p>It has to be noted that Mr. Harrison's list of the books which
deserve perusal would seem to indicate that in his opinion, the
pleasures to be derived from literature are chiefly pleasures of
the imagination. Poets, dramatists, and novelists form the chief
portion of the somewhat meagre fare which is specifically permitted
to his disciples. Now, though I have already stated that the list
is not one of which any person is likely to assert that it contains
books which ought to be excluded, yet, even from the point of view
of what may be termed aesthetic enjoyment, the field in which we
are allowed to take our pleasures seems to me unduly
restricted.</p>
<p>Contemporary poetry, for instance, on which Mr. Harrison bestows
a good deal of hard language, has and must have, for the generation
which produces it, certain qualities not likely to be possessed by
any other. Charles Lamb has somewhere declared that a pun loses all
its virtues as soon as the momentary quality of the intellectual
and social atmosphere in which it was born has changed its
character. What is true of this, the humblest effort of verbal art,
is true in a different measure and degree of all, even of the
highest, forms of literature. To some extent every work requires
interpretation to generations who are separated by differences of
thought or education from the age in which it was originally
produced. That this is so with every book which depends for its
interest upon feelings and fashions which have utterly vanished, no
one will be disposed, I imagine, to deny. Butler's 'Hudibras,' for
instance, which was the delight of a gay and witty society, is to
me at least not unfrequently dull. Of some works, no doubt, which
made a noise in their day it seems impossible to detect the
slightest race of charm. But this is not the case with 'Hudibras.'
Its merits are obvious. That they should have appealed to a
generation sick of the reign of the "Saints" is precisely what we
should have expected. But to us, who are not sick of the reign of
the Saints, they appeal but imperfectly. The attempt to reproduce
artificially the frame of mind of those who first read the poem is
not only an effort, but is to most people, at all events, an
unsuccessful effort. What is true of 'Hudibras' is true also,
though in an inconceivably smaller degree, of those great works of
imagination which deal with the elemental facts of human character
and human passion. Yet even on these, time does, though lightly,
lay his hand. Wherever what may be called "historic sympathy" is
required, there will be some diminution of the enjoyment which
those must have felt who were the poet's contemporaries. We look,
so to speak, at the same splendid landscape as they, but distance
has made it necessary for us to aid our natural vision with
glasses, and some loss of light will thus inevitably be produced,
and some inconvenience from the difficulty of truly adjusting the
focus. Of all authors, Homer would, I suppose, be thought to suffer
least from such drawbacks. But yet in order to listen to Homer's
accents with the ears of an ancient Greek, we must be able, among
other things, to enter into a view about the gods which is as far
removed from what we should describe as religious sentiment, as it
is from the frigid ingenuity of those later poets who regarded the
deities of Greek mythology as so many wheels in the supernatural
machinery with which it pleased them to carry on the action of
their pieces. If we are to accept Mr. Herbert Spencer's views as to
the progress of our species, changes of sentiment are likely to
occur which will even more seriously interfere with the world's
delight in the Homeric poems. When human beings become so nicely
"adjusted to their environment" that courage and dexterity in
battle will have become as useless among civic virtues as an old
helmet is among the weapons of war; when fighting gets to be looked
upon with the sort of disgust excited in us by cannibalism; and
when public opinion shall regard a warrior much in the same light
that we regard a hangman,--I do not see how any fragment of that
vast and splendid literature which depends for its interest upon
deeds of heroism and the joy of battle is to retain its ancient
charm.</p>
<p>About these remote contingencies, however, I am glad to think
that neither you nor I need trouble our heads; and if I
parenthetically allude to them now, it is merely as an illustration
of a truth not always sufficiently remembered, and as an excuse for
those who find in the genuine, though possibly second-rate,
productions of their own age, a charm for which they search in vain
among the mighty monuments of the past.</p>
<p>But I leave this train of thought, which has perhaps already
taken me too far, in order to point out a more fundamental error,
as I think it, which arises from regarding literature solely from
this high aesthetic standpoint. The pleasures of imagination,
derived from the best literary models, form without doubt the most
exquisite portion of the enjoyment which we may extract from books;
but they do not, in my opinion, form the largest portion if we take
into account mass as well as quality in our calculation. There is
the literature which appeals to the imagination or the fancy, some
stray specimens of which Mr. Harrison will permit us to peruse; but
is there not also the literature which satisfies the curiosity? Is
this vast storehouse of pleasure to be thrown hastily aside because
many of the facts which it contains are alleged to be
insignificant, because the appetite to which they minister is said
to be morbid? Consider a little. We are here dealing with one of
the strongest intellectual impulses of rational beings. Animals, as
a rule, trouble themselves but little about anything unless they
want either to eat it or to run away from it. Interest in and
wonder at the works of nature and the doings of man are products of
civilization, and excite emotions which do not diminish but
increase with increasing knowledge and cultivation. Feed them and
they grow; minister to them and they will greatly multiply. We hear
much indeed of what is called "idle curiosity"; but I am loth to
brand any form of curiosity as necessarily idle. Take, for example,
one of the most singular, but in this age one of the most
universal, forms in which it is accustomed to manifest itself: I
mean that of an exhaustive study of the contents of the morning and
evening papers. It is certainly remarkable that any person who has
nothing to get by it should destroy his eyesight and confuse his
brain by a conscientious attempt to master the dull and doubtful
details of the European diary daily transmitted to us by "Our
Special Correspondent." But it must be remembered that this is only
a somewhat unprofitable exercise of that disinterested love of
knowledge which moves men to penetrate the Polar snows, to build up
systems of philosophy, or to explore the secrets of the remotest
heavens. It has in it the rudiments of infinite and varied
delights. It <i>can</i> be turned, and it <i>should</i> be turned
into a curiosity for which nothing that has been done, or thought,
or suffered, or believed, no law which governs the world of matter
or the world of mind, can be wholly alien or uninteresting.</p>
<p>Truly it is a subject for astonishment that, instead of
expanding to the utmost the employment of this pleasure-giving
faculty, so many persons should set themselves to work to limit its
exercise by all kinds of arbitrary regulations. Some there are, for
example, who tell us that the acquisition of knowledge is all very
well, but that it must be <i>useful</i> knowledge; meaning usually
thereby that it must enable a man to get on in a profession, pass
an examination, shine in conversation, or obtain a reputation for
learning. But even if they mean something higher than this, even if
they mean that knowledge to be worth anything must subserve
ultimately if not immediately the material or spiritual interests
of mankind, the doctrine is one which should be energetically
repudiated. I admit, of course, at once, that discoveries the most
apparently remote from human concerns have often proved themselves
of the utmost commercial or manufacturing value. But they require
no such justification for their existence, nor were they striven
for with any such object. Navigation is not the final cause of
astronomy, nor telegraphy of electro-dynamics, nor dye-works of
chemistry. And if it be true that the desire of knowledge for the
sake of knowledge was the animating motive of the great men who
first wrested her secrets from nature, why should it not also be
enough for us, to whom it is not given to discover, but only to
learn as best we may what has been discovered by others?</p>
<p>Another maxim, more plausible but equally pernicious, is that
superficial knowledge is worse than no knowledge at all. That "a
little knowledge is a dangerous thing" is a saying which has now
got currency as a proverb stamped in the mint of Pope's
versification; of Pope, who with the most imperfect knowledge of
Greek translated Homer, with the most imperfect knowledge of the
Elizabethan drama edited Shakespeare, and with the most imperfect
knowledge of philosophy wrote the 'Essay on Man.' But what is this
"little knowledge" which is supposed to be so dangerous? What is it
"little" in relation to? If in relation to what there is to know,
then all human knowledge is little. If in relation to what actually
is known by somebody, then we must condemn as "dangerous" the
knowledge which Archimedes possessed of mechanics, or Copernicus of
astronomy; for a shilling primer and a few weeks' study will enable
any student to outstrip in mere information some of the greatest
teachers of the past. No doubt, that little knowledge which thinks
itself to be great may possibly be a dangerous, as it certainly is
a most ridiculous thing. We have all suffered under that eminently
absurd individual who on the strength of one or two volumes,
imperfectly apprehended by himself, and long discredited in the
estimation of everyone else, is prepared to supply you on the
shortest notice with a dogmatic solution of every problem suggested
by this "unintelligible world" or the political variety of the same
pernicious genus, whose statecraft consists in the ready
application to the most complex question of national interest of
some high-sounding commonplace which has done weary duty on a
thousand platforms, and which even in its palmiest days was never
fit for anything better than a peroration. But in our dislike of
the individual, do not let us mistake the diagnosis of his disease.
He suffers not from ignorance but from stupidity. Give him learning
and you make him not wise, but only more pretentious in his
folly.</p>
<p>I say then that so far from a little knowledge being
undesirable, a little knowledge is all that on most subjects any of
us can hope to attain; and that, as a source not of worldly profit
but of personal pleasure, it may be of incalculable value to its
possessor. But it will naturally be asked, "How are we to select
from among the infinite number of things which may be known, those
which it is best worth while for us to know?" We are constantly
being told to concern ourselves with learning what is important,
and not to waste our energies upon what is insignificant. But what
are the marks by which we shall recognize the important, and how is
it to be distinguished from the insignificant. A precise and
complete answer to this question which shall be true for all men
cannot be given. I am considering knowledge, recollect, as it
ministers to enjoyment; and from this point of view each unit of
information is obviously of importance in proportion as it
increases the general sum of enjoyment which we obtain, or expect
to obtain, from knowledge. This, of course, makes it impossible to
lay down precise rules which shall be an equally sure guide to all
sorts and conditions of men; for in this, as in other matters,
tastes must differ, and against real difference of taste there is
no appeal.</p>
<p>There is, however, one caution which it may be worth your while
to keep in view:--Do not be persuaded into applying any general
proposition on this subject with a foolish impartiality to every
kind of knowledge. There are those who tell you that it is the
broad generalities and the far-reaching principles which govern the
world, which are alone worthy of your attention. A fact which is
not an illustration of a law, in the opinion of these persons
appears to lose all its value. Incidents which do not fit into some
great generalization, events which are merely picturesque, details
which are merely curious, they dismiss as unworthy the interest of
a reasoning being. Now, even in science this doctrine in its
extreme form does not hold good. The most scientific of men have
taken profound interest in the investigation of facts from the
determination of which they do not anticipate any material addition
to our knowledge of the laws which regulate the Universe. In these
matters, I need hardly say that I speak wholly without authority.
But I have always been under the impression that an investigation
which has cost hundreds of thousands of pounds; which has stirred
on three occasions the whole scientific community throughout the
civilized world; on which has been expended the utmost skill in the
construction of instruments and their application to purposes of
research (I refer to the attempts made to determine the distance of
the sun by observation of the transit of Venus),--would, even if
they had been brought to a successful issue, have furnished mankind
with the knowledge of no new astronomical principle. The laws which
govern the motions of the solar system, the proportions which the
various elements in that system bear to one another, have long been
known. The distance of the sun itself is known within limits of
error relatively speaking not very considerable. Were the measuring
rod we apply to the heavens based on an estimate of the sun's
distance from the earth which was wrong by (say) three per cent.,
it would not to the lay mind seem to affect very materially our
view either of the distribution of the heavenly bodies or of their
motions. And yet this information, this piece of celestial gossip,
would seem to have been the chief astronomical result expected from
the successful prosecution of an investigation in which whole
nations have interested themselves.</p>
<p>But though no one can, I think, pretend that science does not
concern itself, and properly concern itself, with facts which are
not to all appearance illustrations of law, it is undoubtedly true
that for those who desire to extract the greatest pleasure from
science, a knowledge, however elementary, of the leading principles
of investigation and the larger laws of nature, is the acquisition
most to be desired. To him who is not a specialist, a comprehension
of the broad outlines of the universe as it presents itself to his
scientific imagination is the thing most worth striving to attain.
But when we turn from science to what is rather vaguely called
history, the same principles of study do not, I think, altogether
apply, and mainly for this reason: that while the recognition of
the reign of law is the chief amongst the pleasures imparted by
science, our inevitable ignorance makes it the least among the
pleasures imparted by history.</p>
<p>It is no doubt true that we are surrounded by advisers who tell
us that all study of the past is barren, except in so far as it
enables us to determine the principles by which the evolution of
human societies is governed. How far such an investigation has been
up to the present time fruitful in results, it would be unkind to
inquire. That it will ever enable us to trace with accuracy the
course which States and nations are destined to pursue in the
future, or to account in detail for their history in the past, I do
not in the least believe. We are borne along like travelers on some
unexplored stream. We may know enough of the general configuration
of the globe to be sure that we are making our way towards the
ocean. We may know enough, by experience or theory, of the laws
regulating the flow of liquids, to conjecture how the river will
behave under the varying influences to which it may be subject.
More than this we cannot know. It will depend largely upon causes
which, in relation to any laws which we are even likely to discover
may properly be called accidental, whether we are destined
sluggishly to drift among fever-stricken swamps, to hurry down
perilous rapids, or to glide gently through fair scenes of peaceful
cultivation.</p>
<p>But leaving on one side ambitious sociological speculations, and
even those more modest but hitherto more successful investigations
into the causes which have in particular cases been principally
operative in producing great political changes, there are still two
modes in which we can derive what I may call "spectacular"
enjoyment from the study of history. There is first the pleasure
which arises from the contemplation of some great historic drama,
or some broad and well-marked phase of social development. The
story of the rise, greatness, and decay of a nation is like some
vast epic which contains as subsidiary episodes the varied stories
of the rise, greatness, and decay of creeds, of parties, and of
statesmen. The imagination is moved by the slow unrolling of this
great picture of human mutability, as it is moved by the contrasted
permanence of the abiding stars. The ceaseless conflict, the
strange echoes of long-forgotten controversies, the confusion of
purpose, the successes in which lay deep the seeds of future evils,
the failures that ultimately divert the otherwise inevitable
danger, the heroism which struggles to the last for a cause
foredoomed to defeat, the wickedness which sides with right, and
the wisdom which huzzas at the triumph of folly,--fate, meanwhile,
amidst this turmoil and perplexity, working silently towards the
predestined end,--all these form together a subject the
contemplation of which need surely never weary.</p>
<p>But yet there is another and very different species of enjoyment
to be derived from the records of the past, which requires a
somewhat different method of study in order that it may be fully
tasted. Instead of contemplating as it were from a distance the
larger aspects of the human drama, we may elect to move in familiar
fellowship amid the scenes and actors of special periods. We may
add to the interest we derive from the contemplation of
contemporary politics, a similar interest derived from a not less
minute, and probably more accurate, knowledge of some comparatively
brief passage in the political history of the past. We may extend
the social circle in which we move, a circle perhaps narrowed and
restricted through circumstances beyond our control, by making
intimate acquaintances, perhaps even close friends, among a society
long departed, but which, when we have once learnt the trick of it,
we may, if it so pleases us, revive.</p>
<p>It is this kind of historical reading which is usually branded
as frivolous and useless; and persons who indulge in it often
delude themselves into thinking that the real motive of their
investigation into bygone scenes and ancient scandals is
philosophic interest in an important historical episode, whereas in
truth it is not the philosophy which glorifies the details, but the
details which make tolerable the philosophy. Consider, for example,
the case of the French Revolution. The period from the taking of
the Bastile to the fall of Robespierre is about the same as that
which very commonly intervenes between two of our general
elections. On these comparatively few months, libraries have been
written. The incidents of every week are matters of familiar
knowledge. The character and the biography of every actor in the
drama has been made the subject of minute study; and by common
admission there is no more fascinating page in the history of the
world. But the interest is not what is commonly called philosophic,
it is personal. Because the Revolution is the dominant fact in
modern history, therefore people suppose that the doings of this or
that provincial lawyer, tossed into temporary eminence and eternal
infamy by some freak of the revolutionary wave, or the atrocities
committed by this or that mob, half drunk with blood, rhetoric, and
alcohol, are of transcendent importance. In truth their interest is
great, but their importance is small. What we are concerned to know
as students of the philosophy of history is, not the character of
each turn and eddy in the great social cataract, but the manner in
which the currents of the upper stream drew surely in towards the
final plunge, and slowly collected themselves after the catastrophe
again, to pursue at a different level their renewed and
comparatively tranquil course.</p>
<p>Now, if so much of the interest of the French Revolution depends
upon our minute knowledge of each passing incident, how much more
necessary is such knowledge when we are dealing with the quiet
nooks and corners of history; when we are seeking an introduction,
let us say, into the literary society of Johnson, or the
fashionable society of Walpole. Society, dead or alive, can have no
charm without intimacy, and no intimacy without interest in trifles
which I fear Mr. Harrison would describe as "merely curious." If we
would feel at our ease in any company, if we wish to find humor in
its jokes, and point in its repartees, we must know something of
the beliefs and the prejudices of its various members, their loves
and their hates, their hopes and their fears, their maladies, their
marriages, and their flirtations. If these things are beneath our
notice, we shall not be the less qualified to serve our Queen and
country, but need make no attempt to extract pleasure from one of
the most delightful departments of literature.</p>
<p>That there is such a thing as trifling information I do not of
course question; but the frame of mind in which the reader is
constantly weighing the exact importance to the universe at large
of each circumstance which the author presents to his notice, is
not one conducive to the true enjoyment of a picture whose effect
depends upon a multitude of slight and seemingly insignificant
touches, which impress the mind often without remaining in the
memory. The best method of guarding against the danger of reading
what is useless is to read only what is interesting; a truth which
will seem a paradox to a whole class of readers, fitting objects of
our commiseration, who may be often recognized by their habit of
asking some adviser for a list of books, and then marking out a
scheme of study in the course of which all are to be
conscientiously perused. These unfortunate persons apparently read
a book principally with the object of getting to the end of it.
They reach the word <i>Finis</i> with the same sensation of triumph
as an Indian feels who strings a fresh scalp to his girdle. They
are not happy unless they mark by some definite performance each
step in the weary path of self-improvement. To begin a volume and
not to finish it would be to deprive themselves of this
satisfaction; it would be to lose all the reward of their earlier
self-denial by a lapse from virtue at the end. To skip, according
to their literary code, is a species of cheating; it is a mode of
obtaining credit for erudition on false pretenses; a plan by which
the advantages of learning are surreptitiously obtained by those
who have not won them by honest toil. But all this is quite wrong.
In matters literary, works have no saving efficacy. He has only
half learnt the art of reading who has not added to it the even
more refined accomplishments of skipping and of skimming; and the
first step has hardly been taken in the direction of making
literature a pleasure until interest in the subject, and not a
desire to spare (so to speak) the author's feelings, or to
accomplish an appointed task, is the prevailing motive of the
reader.</p>
<p>I have now reached, not indeed the end of my subject, which I
have scarcely begun, but the limits inexorably set by the
circumstances under which it is treated. Yet I am unwilling to
conclude without meeting an objection to my method of dealing with
it, which has I am sure been present to the minds of not a few who
have been good enough to listen to me with patience. It will be
said that I have ignored the higher functions of literature; that I
have degraded it from its rightful place, by discussing only
certain ways in which it may minister to the entertainment of an
idle hour, leaving wholly out of sight its contributions to what
Mr. Harrison calls our "spiritual sustenance." Now, this is partly
because the first of these topics and not the second was the avowed
subject of my address; but it is partly because I am deliberately
of opinion that it is the pleasures and not the profits, spiritual
or temporal, of literature which most require to be preached in the
ear of the ordinary reader. I hold indeed the faith that all such
pleasures minister to the development of much that is best in
man--mental and moral; but the charm is broken and the object lost
if the remote consequence is consciously pursued to the exclusion
of the immediate end. It will not, I suppose, be denied that the
beauties of nature are at least as well qualified to minister to
our higher needs as are the beauties of literature. Yet we do not
say we are going to walk to the top of such and such a hill in
order to drink in "spiritual sustenance." We say we are going to
look at the view. And I am convinced that this, which is the
natural and simple way of considering literature as well as nature,
is also the true way. The habit of always requiring some reward for
knowledge beyond the knowledge itself, be that reward some material
prize or be it what is vaguely called self-improvement, is one with
which I confess I have little sympathy, fostered though it is by
the whole scheme of our modern education. Do not suppose that I
desire the impossible. I would not if I could destroy the
examination system. But there are times, I confess, when I feel
tempted somewhat to vary the prayer of the poet, and to ask whether
Heaven has not reserved, in pity to this much-educating generation,
some peaceful desert of literature as yet unclaimed by the crammer
or the coach; where it might be possible for the student to wander,
even perhaps to stray, at his own pleasure without finding every
beauty labeled, every difficulty engineered, every nook surveyed,
and a professional cicerone standing at every corner to guide each
succeeding traveler along the same well-worn round. If such a wish
were granted, I would further ask that the domain of knowledge thus
"neutralized" should be the literature of our own country. I grant
to the full that the systematic study of <i>some</i> literature
must be a principal element in the education of youth. But why
should that literature be our own? Why should we brush off the
bloom and freshness from the works to which Englishmen and
Scotchmen most naturally turn for refreshment,--namely, those
written in their own language? Why should we associate them with
the memory of hours spent in weary study; in the effort to remember
for purposes of examination what no human being would wish to
remember for any other; in the struggle to learn something, not
because the learner desires to know it, because he desires some one
else to know that he knows it? This is the dark side of the
examination system; a system necessary and therefore excellent, but
one which does, through the very efficiency and thoroughness of the
drill by which it imparts knowledge, to some extent impair the most
delicate pleasures by which the acquisition of knowledge should be
attended.</p>
<p>How great those pleasures may be, I trust there are many here
who can testify. When I compare the position of the reader of
to-day with that of his predecessor of the sixteenth century. I am
amazed at the ingratitude of those who are tempted even for a
moment to regret the invention of printing and the multiplication
of books. There is now no mood of mind to which a man may not
administer the appropriate nutriment or medicine at the cost of
reaching down a volume from his bookshelf. In every department of
knowledge infinitely more is known, and what is known is
incomparably more accessible, than it was to our ancestors. The
lighter forms of literature, good, bad, and indifferent, which have
added so vastly to the happiness of mankind, have increased beyond
powers of computation; nor do I believe that there is any reason to
think that they have elbowed out their more serious and important
brethren. It is perfectly possible for a man, not a professed
student, and who only gives to reading the leisure hours of a
business life, to acquire such a general knowledge of the laws of
nature and the facts of history that every great advance made in
either department shall be to him both intelligible and
interesting; and he may besides have among his familiar friends
many a departed worthy whose memory is embalmed in the pages of
memoir or biography. All this is ours for the asking. All this we
shall ask for, if only it be our happy fortune to love for its own
sake the beauty and the knowledge to be gathered from books. And if
this be our fortune, the world may be kind or unkind, it may seem
to us to be hastening on the wings of enlightenment and progress to
an imminent millennium, or it may weigh us down with the sense of
insoluble difficulty and irremediable wrong; but whatever else it
be, so long as we have good health and a good library, it can
hardly be dull.</p>

<h2>THE <a name="BALLAD"></a>BALLAD</h2>
<center>(Popular or Communal)</center>
<br>
<center>BY F.B. GUMMERE</center>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>he popular ballad, as it is understood for the purpose of these
selections, is a narrative in lyric form, with no traces of
individual authorship, and is preserved mainly by oral tradition.
In its earliest stages it was meant to be sung by a crowd, and got
its name from the dance to which it furnished the sole musical
accompaniment. In these primitive communities the ballad was
doubtless chanted by the entire folk, in festivals mainly of a
religious character. Explorers still meet something of the sort in
savage tribes: and children's games preserve among us some relics
of this protoplasmic form of verse-making, in which the single poet
or artist was practically unknown, and spontaneous, improvised
verses arose out of the occasion itself; in which the whole
community took part; and in which the beat of foot--along with the
gesture which expressed narrative elements of the song--was
inseparable from the words and the melody. This native growth of
song, in which the chorus or refrain, the dance of a festal
multitude, and the spontaneous nature of the words, were vital
conditions, gradually faded away before the advance of cultivated
verse and the vigor of production in what one may call poetry of
the schools. Very early in the history of the ballad, a demand for
more art must have called out or at least emphasized the artist,
the poet, who chanted new verses while the throng kept up the
refrain or burden. Moreover, as interest was concentrated upon the
words or story, people began to feel that both dance and melody
were separable if not alien features; and thus they demanded the
composed and recited ballad, to the harm and ultimate ruin of that
spontaneous song for the festal, dancing crowd. Still, even when
artistry had found a footing in ballad verse, it long remained mere
agent and mouthpiece for the folk; the communal character of the
ballad was maintained in form and matter. Events of interest were
sung in almost contemporary and entirely improvised verse; and the
resulting ballads, carried over the borders of their community and
passed down from generation to generation, served as newspaper to
their own times and as chronicle to posterity. It is the kind of
song to which Tacitus bears witness as the sole form of history
among the early Germans; and it is evident that such a stock of
ballads must have furnished considerable raw material to the epic.
Ballads, in whatever original shape, went to the making of the
English 'B&eacute;owulf,' of the German 'Nibelungenlied.' Moreover,
a study of dramatic poetry leads one back to similar communal
origins. What is loosely called a "chorus,"--originally, as the
name implies, a dance--out of which older forms of the drama were
developed, could be traced back to identity with primitive forms of
the ballad. The purely lyrical ballad, even, the <i>chanson</i> of
the people, so rare in English but so abundant among other races,
is evidently a growth from the same root.</p>
<p>If, now, we assume for this root the name of communal poem, and
if we bear in mind the dominant importance of the individual, the
artist, in advancing stages of poetry, it is easy to understand why
for civilized and lettered communities the ballad has ceased to
have any vitality whatever. Under modern conditions the making of
ballads is a closed account. For our times poetry means something
written by a poet, and not something sung more or less
spontaneously by a dancing throng. Indeed, paper and ink, the
agents of preservation in the case of ordinary verse, are for
ballads the agents of destruction. The broadside press of three
centuries ago, while it rescued here and there a genuine ballad,
poured out a mass of vulgar imitations which not only displaced and
destroyed the ballad of oral tradition, but brought contempt upon
good and bad alike. Poetry of the people, to which our ballad
belongs, is a thing of the past. Even rude and distant communities,
like those of Afghanistan, cannot give us the primitive conditions.
The communal ballad is rescued, when rescued at all, by the fragile
chances of a written copy or of oral tradition; and we are obliged
to study it under terms of artistic poetry,--that is, we are forced
to take through the eye and the judgment what was meant for the ear
and immediate sensation. Poetry <i>for</i> the people, however,
"popular poetry" in the modern phrase, is a very different affair.
Street songs, vulgar rhymes, or even improvisations of the
concert-halls, tawdry and sentimental stuff,--these things are
sundered by the world's width from poetry <i>of</i> the people,
from the folk in verse, whether it echo in a great epos which
chants the clash of empires or linger in a ballad of the
countryside sung under the village linden. For this ballad is a
part of the poetry which comes from the people as a whole, from a
homogeneous folk, large or small; while the song of street or
concert-hall is deliberately composed for a class, a section, of
the community. It would therefore be better to use some other term
than "popular" when we wish to specify the ballad of tradition, and
so avoid all taint of vulgarity and the trivial. Nor must we go to
the other extreme. Those high-born people who figure in traditional
ballads--Childe Waters, Lady Maisry, and the rest--do not require
us to assume composition in aristocratic circles; for the lower
classes of the people in ballad days had no separate literature,
and a ballad of the folk belonged to the community as a whole. The
same habit of thought, the same standard of action, ruled alike the
noble and his meanest retainer. Oral transmission, the test of the
ballad, is of course nowhere possible save in such an unlettered
community. Since all critics are at one in regard to this
homogeneous character of the folk with whom and out of whom these
songs had their birth, one is justified in removing all doubt from
the phrase by speaking not of the popular ballad but of the
communal ballad, the ballad of a community.</p>
<p>With regard to the making of a ballad, one must repeat a
caution, hinted already, and made doubly important by a vicious
tendency in the study of all phases of culture. It is a vital
mistake to explain primitive conditions by exact analogy with
conditions of modern savagery and barbarism. Certain conclusions,
always guarded and cautious to a degree, may indeed be drawn; but
it is folly to insist that what now goes on among shunted races,
belated detachments in the great march of culture, must have gone
on among the dominant and mounting peoples who had reached the same
external conditions of life. The homogeneous and unlettered state
of the ballad-makers is not to be put on a level with the ignorance
of barbarism, nor explained by the analogy of songs among modern
savage tribes. Fortunately we have better material. The making of a
ballad by a community can be illustrated from a case recorded by
Pastor Lyngbye in his invaluable account of life on the Faroe
Islands a century ago. Not only had the islanders used from most
ancient times their traditional and narrative songs as music for
the dance, but they had also maintained the old fashion of making a
ballad. In the winter, says Lyngbye, dancing is their chief
amusement and is an affair of the entire community. At such a
dance, one or more persons begin to sing; then all who are present
join in the ballad, or at least in the refrain. As they dance, they
show by their gestures and expression that they follow with
eagerness the course of the story which they are singing. More than
this, the ballad is often a spontaneous product of the occasion. A
fisherman, who has had some recent mishap with his boat, is pushed
by stalwart comrades into the middle of the throng, while the
dancers sing verses about him and his lack of skill,--verses
improvised on the spot and with a catching and clamorous refrain.
If these verses win favor, says Lyngbye, they are repeated from
year to year, with slight additions or corrections, and become a
permanent ballad. Bearing in mind the extraordinary readiness to
improvise shown even in these days by peasants in every part of
Europe, we thus gain some definite notion about the spontaneous and
communal elements which went to the making of the best type of
primitive verse; for these Faroe islanders were no savages, but
simply a homeogeneous and isolated folk which still held to the old
ways of communal song.</p>
<p>Critics of the ballad, moreover, agree that it has little or no
subjective traits,--an easy inference from the conditions just
described. There is no individuality lurking behind the words of
the ballad, and above all, no evidence of that individuality in the
form of sentiment. Sentiment and individuality are the very essence
of modern poetry, and the direct result of individualism in verse.
Given a poet, sentiment--and it may be noble and precious
enough--is sure to follow. But the ballad, an epic in little,
forces one's attention to the object, the scene, the story, and
away from the maker.</p>
<blockquote>"The king sits in Dumferling town."</blockquote>
<p>begins one of the noblest of all ballads; while one of the
greatest of modern poems opens with something personal and
pathetic, key-note to all that follows:--</p>
<blockquote>"My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains<br>
My sense ..."</blockquote>
<p>Even when a great poet essays the ballad, either he puts
sentiment into it, or else he keeps sentiment out of it by a
<i>tour de force</i>. Admirable and noble as one must call the
conclusion of an artistic ballad such as Tennyson's 'Revenge,' it
is altogether different from the conclusion of such a communal
ballad as 'Sir Patrick Spens.' That subtle quality of the ballad
which lies in solution with the story and which--as in 'Child
Maurice' or 'Babylon' or 'Edward'--compels in us sensations akin to
those called out by the sentiment of the poet, is a wholly
impersonal if strangely effective quality, far removed from the
corresponding elements of the poem of art. At first sight, one
might say that Browning's dramatic lyrics had this impersonal
quality. But compare the close of 'Give a Rouse,' chorus and all,
with the close of 'Child Maurice,' that swift and relentless stroke
of pure tragedy which called out the enthusiasm of so great a
critic as Gray.</p>
<p>The narrative of the communal ballad is full of leaps and
omissions; the style is simple to a fault; the diction is
spontaneous and free. Assonance frequently takes the place of
rhyme, and a word often rhymes with itself. There is a lack of
poetic adornment in the style quite as conspicuous as the lack of
reflection and moralizing in the matter. Metaphor and simile are
rare and when found are for the most part standing phrases common
to all the ballads; there is never poetry for poetry's sake.
Iteration is the chief mark of ballad style; and the favorite form
of this effective figure is what one may call incremental
repetition. The question is repeated with the answer; each
increment in a series of related facts has a stanza for itself,
identical, save for the new fact, with the other stanzas. 'Babylon'
furnishes good instances of this progressive iteration. Moreover,
the ballad differs from earlier English epics in that it invariably
has stanzas and rhyme; of the two forms of stanza, the two-line
stanza with a refrain is probably older than the stanza with four
or six lines.</p>
<p>This necessary quality of the stanza points to the origin of the
ballad in song; but longer ballads, such as those that make up the
'Gest of Robin Hood,' an epic in little, were not sung as lyrics or
to aid the dance, but were either chanted in a monotonous fashion
or else recited outright. Chappell, in his admirable work on old
English music ('Music of the Olden Time,' ii. 790), names a third
class of "characteristic airs of England,"--the "historical and
very long ballads, ... invariably of simple construction, usually
plaintive.... They were rarely if ever used for dancing." Most of
the longer ballads, however, were doubtless given by one person in
a sort of recitative; this is the case with modern ballads of
Russia and Servia, where the bystanders now and then join in a
chorus. Precisely in the same way ballads were divorced from the
dance, originally their vital condition; but in the refrain, which
is attached to so many ballads, one finds an element which has
survived from those earliest days of communal song.</p>
<p>Of oldest communal poetry no actual ballad has come down to us.
Hints and even fragments, however, are pointed out in ancient
records, mainly as the material of chronicle or legend. In the
Bible (Numbers xxi. 17), where "Israel sang this song," we are not
going too far when we regard the fragment as part of a communal
ballad. "Spring up, O well: sing ye unto it: the princes digged the
well, the nobles of the people digged it, by the direction of the
lawgiver, with their staves." Deborah's song has something of the
communal note; and when Miriam dances and sings with her maidens,
one is reminded of the many ballads made by dancing and singing
bands of women in medi&aelig;val Europe,--for instance, the song
made in the seventh century to the honor of St. Faro, and "sung by
the women as they danced and clapped their hands." The question of
ancient Greek ballads, and their relation to the epic, is not to be
discussed here; nor can we make more than an allusion to the theory
of Niebuhr that the early part of Livy is founded on, old Roman
ballads. A popular discussion of this matter may be found in
Macaulay's preface to his own 'Lays of Ancient Rome.' The ballads
of modern Europe are a survival of older communal poetry, more or
less influenced by artistic and individual conditions of
authorship, but wholly impersonal, and with an appeal to our
interest which seems to come from a throng and not from the
solitary poet. Attention was early called to the ballads of Spain;
printed at first as broadsides, they were gathered into a volume as
early as 1550. On the other hand, ballads were neglected in France
until very recent times; for specimens of the French ballad, and
for an account of it, the reader should consult Professor Crane's
'Chansons Populaires de France,' New York, 1891. It is with ballads
of the Germanic race, however, that we are now concerned. Denmark,
Norway, Sweden, Iceland, the Faroe Islands; Scotland and England;
the Netherlands and Germany: all of these countries offer us
admirable specimens of the ballad. Particularly, the great
collections of Grundtvig ('Danmarks Gamle Folkeviser') for Denmark,
and of Child ('The English and Scottish Popular Ballads') for our
own tongue, show how common descent or borrowing connects the
individual ballads of these groups. "Almost every Norwegian,
Swedish, or Icelandic ballad," says Grundtvig, "is found in a
Danish version of Scandinavian ballads; moreover, a larger number
can be found in English and Scottish versions than in German or
Dutch versions." Again, we find certain national preferences in the
character of the ballads which have come down to us. Scandinavia
kept the old heroic lays (Kaempeviser); Germany wove them into her
epic, as witness the Nibelungen Lay; but England and Scotland have
none of them in any shape. So, too, the mythic ballad, scantily
represented in English, and practically unknown in Germany, abounds
in Scandinavian collections. The Faroe Islands and Norway, as
Grundtvig tells us, show the best record for ballads preserved by
oral tradition; while noble ladies of Denmark, three or four
centuries ago, did high service to ballad literature by making
collections in manuscript of the songs current then in the castle
as in the cottage.</p>
<p>For England, one is compelled to begin the list of known ballads
with the thirteenth century. 'The Battle of Maldon,' composed in
the last decade of the tenth century, though spirited enough and
full of communal vigor, has no stanzaic structure, follows in metre
and style the rules of the Old English epic, and is only a ballad
by courtesy; about the ballads used a century or two later by
historians of England, we can do nothing but guess; and there is no
firm ground under the critic's foot until he comes to the Robin
Hood ballads, which Professor Child assigns to the thirteenth
century. 'The Battle of Otterburn' (1388) opens a series of ballads
based on actual events and stretching into the eighteenth century.
Barring the Robin Hood cycle,--an epic constructed from this
attractive material lies before us in the famous 'Gest of Robin
Hood,' printed as early as 1489,--the chief sources of the
collector are the Percy Manuscript, "written just before 1650,"--on
which, not without omissions and additions, the bishop based his
'Reliques,' first published in 1765,--and the oral traditions of
Scotland, which Professor Child refers to "the last one hundred and
thirty years." Information about the individual ballads, their
sources, history, literary connections, and above all, their
varying texts, must be sought in the noble work of Professor F.J.
Child. For present purposes, a word or two of general information
must suffice. As to origins, there is a wide range. The church
furnished its legend, as in 'St. Stephen'; romance contributed the
story of 'Thomas Rymer'; and the light, even cynical <i>fabliau</i>
is responsible for 'The Boy and the Mantle.' Ballads which occur in
many tongues either may have a common origin or else may owe their
manifold versions, as in the case of popular tales, to a love of
borrowing; and here, of course, we get the hint of wider issues.
For the most part, however, a ballad tells some moving story,
preferably of fighting and of love. Tragedy is the dominant note;
and English ballads of the best type deal with those elements of
domestic disaster so familiar in the great dramas of literature, in
the story of Orestes, or of Hamlet, or of the Cid. Such are
'Edward,' 'Lord Randal,' 'The Two Brothers,' 'The Two Sisters,'
'Child Maurice,' 'Bewick and Graham,' 'Clerk Colven,' 'Little
Musgrave and Lady Barnard,' 'Glasgerion,' and many others. Another
group of ballads, represented by the 'Baron of Brackley' and
'Captain Car,' give a faithful picture of the feuds and ceaseless
warfare in Scotland and on the border. A few fine ballads--'Sweet
William's Ghost,' 'The Wife of Usher's Well'--touch upon the
supernatural. Of the romantic ballads, 'Childe Waters' shows us the
higher, and 'Young Beichan' the lower, but still sound and communal
type. Incipient dramatic tendencies mark 'Edward' and 'Lord
Randal'; while, on the other hand, a lyric note almost carries
'Bonnie George Campbell' out of balladry. Finally, it is to be
noted that in the 'Nut-Brown Maid,' which many would unhesitatingly
refer to this class of poetry, we have no ballad at all, but a
dramatic lyric, probably written by a woman, and with a special
plea in the background.</p>

This ballad is a good specimen of the Robin Hood Cycle, and is
remarkable for its many proverbial and alliterative phrases. A few
lines have been lost between stanzas 2 and 3. Gisborne is a
"market-town in the West Riding of the County of York, on the
borders of Lancashire." For the probable tune of the ballad, see
Chappell's 'Popular Music of the Olden Time,' ii. 397.</blockquote>

<h2>HONOR&Eacute; DE <a name="BALZAC"></a>BALZAC</h2>
<h3>(1799-1850)</h3>
<h3>BY WILLIAM P. TRENT</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-h.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>onor&eacute; de Balzac, by common consent the greatest of French
novelists and to many of his admirers the greatest of all writers
of prose fiction, was born at Tours, May 16th, 1799. Neither his
family nor his place of birth counts for much in his artistic
development; but his sister Laure, afterwards Madame Surville,--to
whom we owe a charming sketch of her brother and many of his most
delightful letters,--made him her hero through life, and gave him a
sympathy that was better than any merely literary environment. He
was a sensitive child, little comprehended by his parents or
teachers, which probably accounts for the fact that few writers
have so well described the feelings of children so situated [See
'Le lys dans la vall&eacute;e' (The Lily in the Valley) and 'Louis
Lambert']. He was not a good student, but undermined his health by
desultory though enormous reading and by writing a precocious
Treatise on the Will, which an irate master burned and the future
novelist afterwards na&iuml;vely deplored. When brought home to
recuperate, he turned from books to nature, and the effects of the
beautiful landscape of Touraine upon his imagination are to be
found throughout his writings, in passages of description worthy of
a nature-worshiper like Senancour himself. About this time a vague
desire for fame seems to have seized him,--a desire destined to
grow into an almost morbid passion; and it was a kindly Providence
that soon after (1814) led his family to quit the stagnant
provinces for that nursery of ambition, Paris. Here he studied
under new masters, heard lectures at the Sorbonne, read in the
libraries, and finally, at the desire of his practical father, took
a three years' course in law.</p>
<br>
<a name="image404.jpg"></a>
<p class="ctr"><a href="images/image404.jpg"><img src=
"images/image404.jpg" width="50%" alt=""></a></p>
<br>
<p>He was now at the parting of the ways, and he chose the one
nearest his heart. After much discussion, it was settled that he
should not be obliged to return to the provinces with his family,
or to enter upon the regular practice of law, but that he might try
his luck as a writer on an allowance purposely fixed low enough to
test his constancy and endurance. Two years was the period of
probation allotted, during which time Balzac read still more widely
and walked the streets studying the characters he met, all the
while endeavoring to grind out verses for a tragedy on Cromwell.
This, when completed, was promptly and justly damned by his family,
and he was temporarily forced to retire from Paris. He did not give
up his aspirations, however, and before long he was back in his
attic, this time supporting himself by his pen. Novels, not
tragedies, were what the public most wanted, so he labored
indefatigably to supply their needs and his own necessities; not
relinquishing, however, the hope that he might some day watch the
performance of one of his own plays. His perseverance was destined
to be rewarded, for he lived to write five dramas which fill a
volume of his collected works; but only one, the posthumous comedy
'Mercadet', was even fairly successful. Yet that Balzac had
dramatic genius his matured novels abundantly prove.</p>
<p>The ten romances, however, that he wrote for cheap booksellers
between 1822 and 1829 displayed so little genius of any sort that
he was afterwards unwilling to cover their deficiencies with his
great name. They have been collected as youthful works ('Oeuvres de
jeunesse'), and are useful to a complete understanding of the
evolution of their author's genius; but they are rarely read even
by his most devoted admirers. They served, however, to enable him
to get through his long and heart-rending period of apprenticeship,
and they taught him how to express himself; for this born novelist
was not a born writer and had to labor painfully to acquire a style
which only at rare moments quite fitted itself to the subject he
had in hand.</p>
<p>Much more interesting than these early sensational romances were
the letters he wrote to his sister Laure, in which he grew eloquent
over his ambition and gave himself needed practice in describing
the characters with whom he came in contact. But he had not the
means to wait quietly and ripen, so he embarked in a publishing
business which brought him into debt. Then, to make up his losses,
he became partner in a printing enterprise which failed in 1827,
leaving him still more embarrassed financially, but endowed with a
fund of experience which he turned to rich account as a novelist.
Henceforth the sordid world of debt, bankruptcy, usury, and
speculation had no mystery for him, and he laid it bare in novel
after novel, utilizing also the knowledge he had gained of the law,
and even pressing into service the technicalities of the printing
office [See 'Illusions perdues' (Lost Illusions)]. But now at the
age of twenty-eight he had over 100,000 francs to pay, and had
written nothing better than some cheap stories; the task of wiping
out his debts by his writings seemed therefore a more hopeless one
than Scott's. Nothing daunted, however, he set to work, and the
year that followed his second failure in business saw the
composition of the first novel he was willing to acknowledge, 'Les
Chouans.' This romance of Brittany in 1799 deserved the praise it
received from press and public, in spite of its badly jointed plot
and overdrawn characters. It still appeals to many readers, and is
important to the 'Com&eacute;die humaine' as being the only novel
of the "Military Scenes.". The 'Physiology of Marriage' followed
quickly (1829-30), and despite a certain pruriency of imagination,
displayed considerable powers of analysis, powers destined shortly
to distinguish a story which ranks high among its author's works,
'La Maison du chat-qui-pelote' (1830). This delightful novelette,
the queer title of which is nearly equivalent to 'At the Sign of
the Cat and the Racket,' showed in its treatment of the heroine's
unhappy passion the intuition and penetration of the born
psychologist, and in its admirable description of bourgeois life
the pictorial genius of the genuine realist. In other words the
youthful romancer was merged once for all in the matured novelist.
The years of waiting and observation had done their work, and along
the streets of Paris now walked the most profound analyst of human
character that had scrutinized society since the days when William
Shakespeare, fresh from Stratford, trod the streets and lanes of
Elizabethan London.</p>
<p>The year 1830 marks the beginning not merely of Balzac's success
as the greatest of modern realists, but also of his marvelous
literary activity. Novel after novel is begun before its
predecessor is finished; short stories of almost perfect
workmanship are completed; sketches are dashed off that will one
day find their appropriate place in larger compositions, as yet
existing only in the brain of the master. Nor is it merely a
question of individual works: novels and stories are to form
different series,--'Scenes from Private Life,' 'Philosophical
Novels and Tales,'--which are themselves destined to merge into
'Studies of Manners in the Nineteenth Century,' and finally into
the 'Com&eacute;die humaine' itself. Yet it was more than a swarm
of stories that was buzzing in his head; it was a swarm of
individuals often more truly alive to him than the friends with
whom he loved to converse about them. And just because he knew
these people of his brain, just because he entered into the least
details of their daily lives, Balzac was destined to become much
more than a mere philosopher or student of society; to wit, a
creator of characters, endowed with that "absolute dramatic vision"
which distinguishes Homer and Shakespeare and Chaucer. But because
he was also something of a philosopher and student of sociology, he
conceived the stupendous idea of linking these characters with one
another and with their several environments, in order that he might
make himself not merely the historian but also the creator of an
entire society. In other words, conservative though he was, Balzac
had the audacity to range himself by the side of Geoffroy
Saint-Hilaire, and to espouse the cause of evolution even in its
infancy. The great ideas of the mutability of species and of the
influence of environment and heredity were, he thought, as
applicable to sociology as to zo&ouml;logy, and as applicable to
fiction as to either. So he meditated the 'Com&eacute;die humaine'
for several years before he announced it in 1842, and from being
almost the rival of Saint-Hilaire he became almost the anticipator
of Darwin.</p>
<p>But this idea of evolution was itself due to the evolution of
his genius, to which many various elements contributed: his
friendships and enmities with contemporary authors, his intimacies
with women of refinement and fashion, his business struggles with
creditors and publishers, his frequent journeys to the provinces
and foreign countries; and finally his grandiose schemes to
surround himself with luxury and the paraphernalia of power, not so
much for his own sake as for the sake of her whose least smile was
a delight and an inspiration. About each of these topics an
interesting chapter might be written, but here a few words must
suffice.</p>
<p>After his position as an author was more or less assured,
Balzac's relations with the leaders of his craft--such as Victor
Hugo, Th&eacute;ophile Gautier, and George Sand--were on the whole
cordial. He had trouble with Sainte-Beuve, however, and often felt
that his brother-writers begrudged his success. His constant
attacks on contemporary journalists, and his egotistic and erratic
manners naturally prejudiced the critics, so that even the
marvelous romance entitled 'La Peau de chagrin' (The Magic Skin:
1831),--a work of superb genius,--speedily followed as it was by
'Eug&eacute;nie Grandet' and 'Le P&egrave;re Goriot,' did not win
him cordial recognition. One or two of his friendships, however,
gave him a knowledge of higher social circles than he was by birth
entitled to, a fact which should be remembered in face of the
charge that he did not know high life, although it is of course
true that a writer like Balzac, possessing the intuition of genius,
need not frequent salons or live in hovels in order to describe
them with absolute verisimilitude.</p>
<p>With regard to Balzac's debts, the fact should be noted that he
might have paid them off more easily and speedily had he been more
prudent. He cut into the profits of his books by the costly changes
he was always making in his proof-sheets,--changes which the artist
felt to be necessary, but against which the publishers naturally
protested. In reality he wrote his books on his proof-sheets, for
he would cut and hack the original version and make new insertions
until he drove his printers wild. Indeed, composition never became
easy to him, although under a sudden inspiration he could sometimes
dash off page after page while other men slept. He had, too, his
affectations; he must even have a special and peculiar garb in
which to write. All these eccentricities and his outside
distractions and ambitions, as well as his noble and pathetic love
affair, entered into the warp and woof of his work with effects
that can easily be detected by the careful student, who should
remember, however, that the master's foibles and peculiarities
never for one moment set him outside the small circle of the men of
supreme genius. He belongs to them by virtue of his tremendous
grasp of life in its totality, his superhuman force of execution
and the inevitableness of his art at its best.</p>
<p>The decade from 1830 to 1840 is the most prolific period of
Balzac's genius in the creation of individual works; that from 1840
to 1850 is his great period of philosophical co-ordination and
arrangement. In the first he hewed out materials for his house; in
the second he put them together. This statement is of course
relatively true only, for we owe to the second decade three of his
greatest masterpieces: 'Splendeurs et mis&egrave;res des
courtisanes,' and 'La Cousine Bette' and 'Le Cousin Pons,'
collectively known as 'Les Parents pauvres' (Poor Relations). And
what a period of masterful literary activity the first decade
presents! For the year 1830 alone the Vicomte de Spoelberch de
Lovenjoul gives seventy-one entries, many of slight importance, but
some familiar to every student of modern literature, such as 'El
Verdugo,' 'La Maison du chat-qui-pelote,' 'Gobseck,' 'Adieu,' 'Une
Passion dans le desert' (A Passion in the Desert), 'Un
&Eacute;pisode sous la Terreur' (An Episode of the Terror). For
1831 there are seventy-six entries, among them such masterpieces as
'Le R&eacute;equisitionnaire' (The Conscript), 'Les Proscrits' (The
Outlaws), 'La Peau de chagrin,' and 'J&eacute;sus-Christ en
Flandre.' In 1832 the number of entries falls to thirty-six, but
among them are 'Le Colonel Chabert,' 'Le Cur&eacute; de Tours' (The
Priest of Tours), 'La Grande Bret&egrave;che,' 'Louis Lambert,' and
'Les Marana.' After this year there are fewer short stories. In
1833 we have 'Le M&eacute;decin de campagne' (The Country Doctor),
and 'Eug&eacute;nie Grandet,' with parts of the 'Histoire des
treize' (Story of the Thirteen), and of the 'Contes drolatiques'
(Droll Tales). The next year gives us 'La Recherche de l'absolu'
(Search for the Absolute) and 'Le P&egrave;re Goriot' (Old Goriot)
and during the next six there were no less than a dozen
masterpieces. Such a decade of accomplishment is little short of
miraculous, and the work was done under stress of anxieties that
would have crushed any normal man.</p>
<p>But anxieties and labors were lightened by a friendship which
was an inspiration long before it ripened into love, and were
rendered bearable both by Balzac's confidence in himself and by his
ever nearer view of the goal he had set himself. The task before
him was as stupendous as that which Comte had undertaken, and
required not merely the planning and writing of new works but the
utilization of all that he had previously written. Untiring labor
had to be devoted to this manipulation of old material, for
practically the great output of the five years 1829-1834 was to be
co-ordinated internally, story being brought into relation with
story and character with character. This meant the creation and
management of an immense number of personages, the careful
investigation of the various localities which served for
environments, and the profound study of complicated social and
political problems. No wonder, then, that the second decade of his
maturity shows a falling off in abundance, though not in intensity
of creative power; and that the gradual breaking down of his
health, under the strain of his ceaseless efforts and of his
abnormal habits of life, made itself more and more felt in the
years that followed the great preface which in 1842 set forth the
splendid design of the 'Com&eacute;die humaine.'</p>
<p>This preface, one of the most important documents in literary
history, must be carefully studied by all who would comprehend
Balzac in his entirety. It cannot be too often repeated that
Balzac's scientific and historical aspirations are important only
in so far as they caused him to take a great step forward in the
development of his art. The nearer the artist comes to reproducing
for us life in its totality, the higher the rank we assign him
among his fellows. Tried by this canon, Balzac is supreme. His
interweaving of characters and events through a series of volumes
gives a verisimilitude to his work unrivaled in prose fiction, and
paralleled only in the work of the world-poets. In other words, his
use of co-ordination upon a vast scale makes up for his lack of
delicacy and sureness of touch, as compared with what Shakespeare
and Homer and Chaucer have taught us to look for. Hence he is with
them even if not of them.</p>
<p>This great claim can be made for the Balzac of the
'Com&eacute;die humaine' only; it could not be made for the Balzac
of any one masterpiece like 'Le P&egrave;re Goriot,' or even for
the Balzac of all the masterpieces taken in lump and without
co-ordination. Balzac by co-ordination has in spite of his
limitations given us a world, just as Shakespeare and Homer have
done; and so Taine was profoundly right when he put him in the same
category with the greatest of all writers. When, however, he added
St. Simon to Shakespeare, and proclaimed that with them Balzac was
the greatest storehouse of documents that we have on human nature,
he was guilty not merely of confounding <i>genres</i> of art, but
also of laying stress on the philosophic rather than on the
artistic side of fiction. Balzac does make himself a great
storehouse of documents on human nature, but he also does something
far more important, he sets before us a world of living men and
women.</p>
<p>To have brought this world into existence, to have given it
order in the midst of complexity, and that in spite of the fact
that death overtook him before he could complete his work, would
have been sufficient to occupy a decade of any other man's life;
but he, though harassed with illness and with hopes of love and
ambition deferred, was strong enough to do more. The year 1840 saw
the appearance of 'Pierrette,' and the establishment of the
ill-fated 'Revue parisienne.' The following year saw 'Ursule
Mirouet,' and until 1848 the stream of great works is practically
unbroken. The 'Splendeurs et mis&egrave;res' and the 'Parents
pauvres' have been named already, but to these must be added 'Un
M&eacute;nage de gar&ccedil;on' (A Bachelor's House-keeping),
'Modeste Mignon,' and 'Les Paysans' (The Peasants). The three
following years added nothing to his work and closed his life, but
they brought him his crowning happiness. On March 14th, 1850, he
was married to Mme. Hanska, at Berditchef; on August 18th, 1850, he
died at Paris.</p>
<p>Madame Evelina de Hanska came into Balzac's life about 1833,
just after he had shaken off the unfortunate influence of the
Duchesse de Castries. The young Polish countess was much impressed,
we are told, by reading the 'Sc&egrave;nes de la vie priv&eacute;e'
(Scenes of Private Life), and was somewhat perplexed and worried by
Balzac's apparent change of method in 'La Peau de chagrin.' She
wrote to him over the signature "L'&Eacute;trang&egrave;re" (A
Foreigner), and he answered in a series of letters recently
published in the Revue de Paris. Not long after the opening of this
correspondence the two met, and a firm friendship was cemented
between them. The lady was about thirty, and married to a Russian
gentleman of large fortune, to whom she had given an only daughter.
She was in the habit of traveling about Europe to carry on this
daughter's education, and Balzac made it his pleasure and duty to
see her whenever he could, sometimes journeying as far as Vienna.
In the interim he would write her letters which possess great charm
and importance to the student of his life. The husband made no
objection to the intimacy, trusting both to his wife and to Balzac;
but for some time before the death of the aged nobleman, Balzac
seems to have distrusted himself and to have held slightly aloof
from the woman whom he was destined finally to love with all the
fervor of his nature. Madame Hanska became free in the winter of
1842-3, and the next summer Balzac visited St. Petersburg to see
her. His love soon became an absorbing passion, but consideration
for her daughter's future withheld the lady's consent to a
betrothal till 1846. It was a period of weary waiting, in which our
sympathies are all on one side; for if ever a man deserved to be
happy in a woman's love, it was Balzac. His happiness came, but
almost too late to be enjoyed. His last two years, which he spent
in Poland with Madame de Hanska, were oppressed by illness, and he
returned to his beloved Paris only to die. The struggle of thirty
years was over, and although his immense genius was not yet fully
recognized, his greatest contemporary, Victor Hugo, was magnanimous
enough to exclaim on hearing that he was dying, "Europe is on the
point of losing a great mind." Balzac's disciples feel that Europe
really lost its greatest writer since Shakespeare.</p>
<p>In the definitive edition of Balzac's writings in twenty-four
volumes, seventeen are occupied by the various divisions of the
'Com&eacute;die humaine.' The plays take up one volume; and the
correspondence, not including of course the letters to
"L'&Eacute;trang&egrave;re," another; the 'Contes drolatiques' make
still another; and finally we have four volumes filled with
sketches, tales, reviews, and historical and political articles
left uncollected by their author.</p>
<p>The 'Contes' are thirty in number, divided into "dixains," each
with its appropriate prologue and epilogue. They purport to have
been collected in the abbeys of Touraine, and set forth by the
Sieur de Balzac for the delight of Pantagruelists and none others.
Not merely the spirit but the very language of Rabelais is caught
with remarkable verve and fidelity, so that from the point of view
of style Balzac has never done better work. A book which holds by
Rabelais on the one hand and by the Queen of Navarre on the other
is not likely, however, to appeal to that part of the English and
American reading public that expurgates its Chaucer, and blushes at
the mention of Fielding and Smollett. Such readers will do well to
avoid the 'Contes drolatiques;' although, like 'Don Juan,' they
contain a great deal of what was best in their author, of his
frank, ebullient, sensuous nature, lighted up here at least by a
genuine if scarcely delicate humor. Of direct suggestion of vice
Balzac was, naturally, as incapable as he was of smug puritanism;
but it must be confessed that as a <i>raconteur</i> his proper
audience, now that the monastic orders have passed away, would be a
group of middle-aged club-men.</p>
<p>The 'Com&eacute;die humaine' is divided into three main
sections: first and most important, the '&Eacute;tudes de moeurs'
(Studies of Manners), second the '&Eacute;tudes philosophiques'
(Philosophic Studies), and finally the '&Eacute;tudes analytiques'
(Analytic Studies). These divisions, as M. Barri&egrave;re points
out in his 'L'Oeuvre de H. de Balzac' (The Work of Balzac), were
intended to bear to one another the relations that moral science,
psychology, and metaphysics do to one another with regard to the
life of man, whether as an individual or as a member of society. No
single division was left complete at the author's death; but enough
was finished and put together to give us the sense of moving in a
living, breathing world, no matter where we make our entry. This,
as we have insisted, is the real secret of his greatness. To think,
for example, that the importance of 'S&eacute;raphita' lies in the
fact that it gives Balzac's view of Swedenborgianism, or that the
importance of 'Louis Lambert' lies in its author's queer theories
about the human will, is entirely to misapprehend his true position
in the world of literature. His mysticism, his psychology, his
theories of economics, his reactionary devotion to monarchy, and
his idealization of the Church of Rome, may or may not appeal to
us, and have certainly nothing that is eternal or inevitable about
them; but in his knowledge of the human mind and heart he is as
inevitable and eternal as any writer has ever been, save only
Shakespeare and Homer.</p>
<p>The '&Eacute;tudes de moeurs' were systematically divided by
their author into 'Scenes of Private Life,' 'Scenes of Provincial
Life,' 'Scenes of Country Life,' 'Scenes of Parisian Life,' 'Scenes
of Political Life,' and 'Scenes of Military Life,'--the last three
divisions representing more or less exceptional phases of
existence. The group relating to Paris is by far the most important
and powerful, but the provincial stories show almost as fine
workmanship, and furnish not a few of the well-known masterpieces.
Less interesting, though still important, are the 'Scenes of
Private Life,' which consist of twenty-four novels, novelettes, and
tales, under the following titles: 'B&eacute;atrix,' 'Albert
Savarus,' 'La Fausse maitresse' (The False Mistress), 'Le Message'
(The Message), 'La Grande Bret&egrave;che,' '&Eacute;tude de femme'
(Study of Woman), 'Autre &eacute;tude de femme' (Another Story of
Woman), 'Madame Firmiani,' 'Modeste Mignon,' 'Un D&eacute;but dans
la vie' (An Entrance upon Life), 'Pierre Grassou,' 'M&eacute;moires
de deux jeunes mari&eacute;es' (Recollections of a Young Couple),
'La Maison du chat-qui-pelote,' 'Le Bal de Sceaux' (The Ball of
Sceaux), 'Le Contrat de mariage' (The Marriage Contract), 'La
Vendetta,' 'La Paix du m&eacute;nage' (Household Peace), 'Une
Double famille' (A Double Family), 'Une Fille d'&Eacute;ve' (A
Daughter of Eve), 'Honorine,' 'La Femme abandonn&eacute;e' (The
Abandoned Wife), 'La Grenadi&egrave;re,' 'La Femme de trente ans'
(The Woman of Thirty).</p>
<p>Of all these stories, hardly one shows genuine greatness except
the powerful tragic tale 'La Grande Bret&egrave;che,' which was
subsequently incorporated in 'Autre &eacute;tude de femme,' This
story of a jealous husband's walling up his wife's lover in a
closet of her chamber is as dramatic a piece of writing as Balzac
ever did, and is almost if not quite as perfect a short story as
any that has since been written in France. 'La Maison du
chat-qui-pelote' has been mentioned already on account of its
importance in the evolution of Balzac's realism, but while a
delightful novelette, it is hardly great, its charm coming rather
from its descriptions of bourgeois life than from the working out
of its central theme, the infelicity of a young wife married to an
unfaithful artist. 'Modeste Mignon' is interesting, and more
romantic than Balzac's later works were wont to be; but while it
may be safely recommended to the average novel-reader, few admirers
of its author would wish to have it taken as a sample of their
master. 'B&eacute;atrix' is a powerful story in its delineation of
the weakness of the young Breton nobleman, Calyste du
Gu&eacute;nie. It derives a factitious interest from the fact that
George Sand is depicted in 'Camille Maupin,' the <i>nom de
plume</i> of Mlle. des Touches, and perhaps Balzac himself in
Claude Vignon, the critic. Less factitious is the interest derived
from Balzac's admirable delineation of a doting mother and aunt,
and from his realistic handling of one of the cleverest of his
ladies of light reputation, Madame Schontz; his studies of such
characters of the <i>demi-monde</i>--especially of the wonderful
Esther of the 'Splendeurs et mis&egrave;res'--serving plainly, by
the way, as a point of departure for Dumas <i>fils</i>. Yet
'B&eacute;atrix' is an able rather than a truly great book, for it
neither elevates nor delights us. In fact, all the stories in this
series are interesting rather than truly great; but all display
Balzac's remarkable analytic powers. Love, false or true, is of
course their main theme; wrought out to a happy issue in 'La
Bourse,' a charming tale, or to a death of despair in 'La
Grenadi&egrave;re' The childless young married woman is contrasted
with her more fortunate friend surrounded by little ones
('M&eacute;moires de deux jeunes mari&eacute;es'), the heartless
coquette flirts once too often ('Le Bal de Sceaux'), the eligible
young man is taken in by a scheming mother ('Le Contrat du
mariage'), the deserted husband labors to win back his wife
('Honorine'), the tempted wife learns at last the real nature of
her peril ('Une Fille d'&Eacute;ve'); in short, lovers and
mistresses, husbands and wives, make us participants of all the
joys and sorrows that form a miniature world within the four walls
of every house.</p>
<p>The 'Scenes of Provincial Life' number only ten stories, but
nearly all of them are masterpieces. They are 'Eug&eacute;nie
Grandet,' 'Le Lys dans la vall&eacute;e,' 'Ursule Mirouet,'
'Pierrette,' 'Le Cur&eacute; de Tours,' 'La Rabouilleuse,' 'La
Vielle fille' (The Old Maid), 'Le Cabinet des antiques' (The
Cabinet of Antiques), 'L'Illustre Gaudissart' (The Illustrious
Gaudissart), and 'La Muse du d&eacute;partement' (The Departmental
Muse). Of these 'Eug&eacute;nie Grandet' is of course easily first
in interest, pathos, and power. The character of old Grandet, the
miserly father, is presented to us with Shakespearean vividness,
although Eug&eacute;nie herself has, less than the Shakespearean
charm. Any lesser artist would have made the tyrant himself and his
yielding wife and daughters seem caricatures rather than living
people. It is only the Shakespeares and Balzacs who are able to
make their Shylocks and lagos, their Grandets and Philippe
Brideaus, monsters and human beings at one and the same time. It is
only the greater artists, too, who can bring out all the pathos
inherent in the subjection of two gentle women to a tyrant in their
own household. But it is Balzac the inimitable alone who can
portray fully the life of the provinces, its banality, its
meanness, its watchful selfishness, and yet save us through the
perfection of his art from the degradation which results from
contact with low and sordid life. The reader who rises unaffected
from a perusal of 'Eug&eacute;nie Grandet' would be unmoved by the
grief of Priam in the tent of Achilles, or of Othello in the
death-chamber of Desdemona.</p>
<p>'Le Lys dans la vall&eacute;e' has been pronounced by an able
French critic to be the worst novel he knows; but as a study of
more or less ethereal and slightly morbid love it is characterized
by remarkable power. Its heroine, Madame Mortsauf, tied to a nearly
insane husband and pursued by a sentimental lover, undergoes
tortures of conscience through an agonizing sense of half-failure
in her duty. Balzac himself used to cite her when he was charged
with not being able to draw a pure woman; but he has created nobler
types. The other stories of the group are also decidedly more
interesting. The distress of the abb&eacute; Birotteau over his
landlady's treatment, and the intrigues of the abb&eacute; Troubert
('Le Cur&eacute; de Tours') absorb us as completely as the career
of Caesar himself in Mommsen's famous chapter. The woes of the
little orphan subjected to the tyranny of her selfish aunt and
uncle ('Pierrette'), the struggles of the rapacious heirs for the
Mirouet fortune ('Ursule Mirouet,') a story which gives us one of
Balzac's purest women, treats interestingly of mesmerism (and may
be read without fear by the young), the siege of Mlle. Cormon's
mature affections by her two adroit suitors ('Une Vielle fille'),
the intrigues against the peace of the d'Esgrignons and the sublime
devotion to their interests of the notary Chesnel ('Le Cabinet des
antiques'), and finally the ignoble passions that fought themselves
out around the senile Jean Jacques Rouget, under the direction of
the diabolical ex-soldier Philippe Brideau ('La Rabouilleuse,'
sometimes entitled 'Un M&eacute;nage de Garcon'), form the
absorbing central themes of a group of novels--or rather stories,
for few of them attain considerable length--unrivaled in the annals
of realistic fiction.</p>
<p>The 'Scenes of Country Life,' comprising 'Les Paysans,' 'Le
M&eacute;decin de campagne,' and 'Le Cur&eacute; de village' (The
Village Priest), take high rank among their author's works. Where
Balzac might have been crudely naturalistic, he has preferred to be
either realistic as in the first named admirable novel, or
idealistic as in the two latter. Hence he has created characters
like the country physician, Doctor Benassis, almost as great a boon
to the world of readers as that philanthropist himself was to the
little village of his adoption. If Madame Graslin of 'Le
Cur&eacute; de village' fails to reach the height of Benassis, her
career has at least a sensational interest which his lacked; and
the country curate, the good abb&eacute; Bonnet, surely makes up
for her lack on the ideal side. This story, by the way, is
important for the light it throws on the workings of the Roman
Church among the common people; and the description of Madame
Graslin's death is one of Balzac's most effective pieces of
writing.</p>
<p>We are now brought to the 'Parisian Scenes,' and with the
exception of 'Eug&eacute;nie Grandet,' to the best-known
masterpieces. There are twenty titles; but as two of these are
collective in character, the number of novels and stories amounts
to twenty-four, as follows:--'Le P&egrave;re Goriot,' 'Illusions
perdues,' 'Splendeurs et mis&egrave;res des courtisanes,' 'Les
Secrets de la princesse de Cadignan' (The Secrets of the Princess
of Cadignan), 'Histoire des treize' [containing 'Ferragus,' 'La
Duchesse de Langeais,' and 'La Fille aux yeux d'or' (The Girl with
the Golden Eyes)], 'Sarrasine,' 'Le Colonel Chabert,'
'L'lnterdiction' (The Interdiction), 'Les Parents pauvres' (Poor
Relations, including 'La Cousine Bette' and 'Le Cousin Pons'), 'La
Messe de l'ath&eacute;e' (The Atheist's Mass), 'Facino Cane,'
'Gobseck,' 'La Maison Nucingen,' 'Un Prince de la Boh&egrave;me' (A
Prince of Bohemia), 'Esquisse d'homme d'affaires' (Sketch of a
Business man), 'Gaudissart II.' 'Les Com&eacute;diens sans le
savoir' (The Unconscious Humorists), 'Les Employ&eacute;s' (The
Employees), 'Histoire de C&eacute;sar Birotteau,' and 'Les Petits
bourgeois' (Little Bourgeois). Of these twenty-four titles six
belong to novels, five of which are of great power, nine to
novelettes and short stories too admirable to be passed over
without notice, eight to novelettes and stories of interest and
value which need not, however, detain us, and one, 'Les Petits
bourgeois', to a novel of much promise unfortunately left
incomplete. 'Les Secrets de la princesse de Cadignan' is remarkable
chiefly as a study of the blind passion that often overtakes a man
of letters. Daniel d'Arthez, the author, a fine character and a
favorite with Balzac, succumbs to the wiles of the Princess of
Cadignan (formerly the dashing and fascinating Duchesse de
Maufrigneuse) and is happy in his subjection. The 'Histoire des
treize' contains three novelettes, linked together through the fact
that in each a band of thirteen young men, sworn to assist one
another in conquering society, play an important part. This volume
is the most frankly sensational of Balzac's works. 'La Duchesse de
Langeais' however, is more than sensational: it gives perhaps
Balzac's best description of the Faubourg St. Germain and one of
his ablest analyses of feminine character, while in the description
of General Montriveau's recognition of the Duchess in the Spanish
convent the novelist's dramatic power is seen at its highest. 'La
Fille aux yeux d'or,' which concludes the volume devoted to the
mysterious brotherhood, may be considered, with 'Sarrasine,' one of
the dark closets of the great building known as the 'Com&eacute;die
humaine.' Both stories deal with unnatural passions, and the first
is one of Balzac's most effective compositions. For sheer
voluptuousness of style there is little in literature to parallel
the description of the boudoir of the uncanny heroine. Very
different from these stories is 'Le Colonel Chabert,' the record of
the misfortunes of one of Napoleon's heroic soldiers, who after
untold hardships returns to France to find his wife married a
second time and determined to deny his existence. The law is
invoked, but the treachery of the wife induces the noble old man to
put an end to the proceedings, after which he sinks into an
indigent and pathetic senility. Balzac has never drawn a more
heart-moving figure, nor has he ever sounded more thoroughly the
depths of human selfishness. But the description of the battle of
Eylau and of Chabert's sufferings in retreat would alone suffice to
make the story memorable. 'L'Interdiction' is the proper pendant to
the history of this unfortunate soldier. In it another husband, the
Marquis d'Espard, suffers from the selfishness of his wife, one of
the worst characters in the range of Balzac's fiction. That she may
keep him from alienating his property to discharge a moral
obligation she endeavors to prove him insane. The legal
complications which ensue bring forward one of Balzac's great
figures, the judge of instruction, Popinot; but to appreciate him
the reader must go to the marvelous book itself. 'Gobseck' is a
study of a Parisian usurer, almost worthy of a place beside the
description of old Grandet; while 'Les Employ&eacute;s' is a
realistic study of bureaucratic life, which, besides showing a
wonderful familiarity with the details of a world of which Balzac
had little personal experience, contains several admirably drawn
characters and a sufficient amount of incident. But it is time to
leave these sketches and novels in miniature, and to pass by the
less important 'Scenes' of this fascinating Parisian life, in order
to consider in some detail the five novels of consummate power.</p>
<p>First of these in date of composition, and in popular estimation
at least among English readers, comes, 'Le P&egrave;re Goriot.' It
is certainly trite to call the book a French "Lear," but the
expression emphasizes the supreme artistic power that could treat
the <i>motif</i> of one of Shakespeare's plays in a manner that
never forces a disadvantageous comparison with the great tragedy.
The retired vermicelli-maker is not as grand a figure as the doting
King of Britain, but he is as real. The French daughters,
Anastasie, Countess de Restaud, and Delphine, Baroness de Nucingen,
are not such types of savage wickedness as Regan and Goneril, but
they fit the nineteenth century as well as the British princesses
did their more barbarous day. Yet there is no Cordelia in 'Le
P&egrave;re Goriot,' for the pale Victorine Taillefer cannot fill
the place of that noblest of daughters. This is but to say that
Balzac's bourgeois tragedy lacks that element of the noble that
every great poetic tragedy must have. The self-immolation of old
Goriot to the cold-hearted ambitions of his daughters is not noble,
but his parental passion touches the infinite, and so proves the
essential kinship of his creator with the creator of Lear. This
touch of the infinite, as in 'Eug&eacute;nie Grandet,' lifts the
book up from the level of a merely masterly study of characters or
a merely powerful novel to that of the supreme masterpieces of
human genius. The marvelously lifelike description of the vulgar
Parisian boarding-house, the fascinating delineation of the
character of that king of convicts, Vautrin, and the fine analysis
of the ambitions of Rastignac (who comes nearer perhaps to being
<i>the</i> hero of the 'Com&eacute;die humaine' than any other of
its characters, and is here presented to us at the threshold of his
successful career) remain in the memory of every reader, but would
never alone have sufficed to make Balzac's name worthy of
immortality. The infinite quality of Goriot's passion would,
however, have conferred this honor on his creator had he never
written another book.</p>
<p>'Illusions perdues' and 'Splendeurs et mis&egrave;res des
courtisanes' might almost be regarded as one novel in seven parts.
More than any other of his works they show the sun of Balzac's
genius at its meridian. Nowhere else does he give us plots so
absorbing, nowhere else does he bring us so completely in contact
with the world his imagination has peopled. The first novel devotes
two of its parts to the provinces and one to Paris. The provincial
stories centre around two brothers-in-law, David S&eacute;chard and
Lucien de Rubempr&eacute;, types of the practical and the artistic
intellect respectively. David, after struggling for fame and
fortune, succumbs and finds his recompense in the love of his wife
Eve, Lucien's sister, one of Balzac's noble women. Lucien, on the
other hand, after some provincial successes as a poet, tries the
great world of Paris, yields to its temptations, fails
ignominiously, and attempts suicide, but is rescued by the great
Vautrin, who has escaped from prison and is about to renew his war
on society disguised as a Spanish priest. Vautrin has conceived the
idea that as he can take no part in society, he will have a
representative in it and taste its pleasures through him. Lucien
accepts this disgraceful position and plunges once more into the
vortex, supported by the strong arm of the king of the convicts.
His career and that of his patron form the subject of the four
parts of the 'Splendeurs et mis&egrave;res' and are too complicated
to be described here. Suffice it to say that probably nowhere else
in fiction are the novel of character and the novel of incident so
splendidly combined; and certainly nowhere else in the range of his
work does Balzac so fully display all his master qualities. That
the story is sensational cannot be denied, but it is at least
worthy of being called the Iliad of Crime. Nemesis waits upon both
Lucien and Vautrin, and upon the poor courtesan Esther whom they
entrap in their toils, and when the two former are at last in
custody, Lucien commits suicide. Vautrin baffles his acute judge in
a wonderful interview; but with his cherished hope cut short by
Lucien's death, finally gives up the struggle. Here the novel might
have ended; yet Balzac adds a fourth part, in order to complete the
career of Vautrin. The famous convict is transformed into a
government spy, and engages to use his immense power against his
former comrades and in defense of the society he has hitherto
warred upon. The artistic propriety of this transformation may be
questioned, but not the power and interest of the novel of which it
is the finishing touch.</p>
<p>Many readers would put the companion novels 'La Cousine Bette'
and 'Le Cousin Pons' at the head of Balzac's works. They have not
the infinite pathos of 'Le P&egrave;re Goriot,' or the superb
construction of the first three parts of the 'Splendeurs et
mis&egrave;res,' but for sheer strength the former at least is
unsurpassed in fiction. Never before or since have the effects of
vice in dragging down a man below the level of the lowest brute
been so portrayed as in Baron Hulot; never before or since has
female depravity been so illustrated as in the diabolical career of
Val&eacute;rie Marneffe, probably the worst woman in fiction. As
for Cousine Bette herself, and her power to breed mischief and
crime, it suffices to say that she is worthy of a place beside the
two chief characters.</p>
<p>'Le Cousin Pons' is a very different book; one which, though
pathetic in the extreme, may be safely recommended to the youngest
reader. The hero who gives his name to the story is an old musician
who has worn out his welcome among his relations, but who becomes
an object of interest to them when they learn that his collection
of bric-a-brac is valuable and that he is about to die. The
intrigues that circulate around this collection and the childlike
German, Schmucke, to whom Pons has bequeathed it, are described as
only the author of 'Le Cur&eacute; de Tours' could have succeeded
in doing; but the book contains also an almost perfect description
of the ideal friendship existing between Pons and Schmucke. One
remembers them longer than one does Frazier, the scoundrelly
advocate who cheats poor Schmucke; a fact which should be cited
against those who urge that Balzac is at home with his vicious
characters only.</p>
<p>The last novel of this group, 'C&eacute;sar Birotteau,' is the
least powerful, though not perhaps the least popular. It is an
excellent study of bourgeois life, and therefore fills an important
place in the scheme of the 'Comedy,' describing as it does the
spreading ambitions of a rich but stupid perfumer, and containing
an admirable study of bankruptcy. It may be dismissed with the
remark that around the innocent Caesar surge most of the scoundrels
that figure in the 'Com&eacute;die humaine,' and with the regret
that it should have been completed while the far more powerful 'Les
Petits bourgeois' was left unfinished.</p>
<p>We now come to the concluding parts of the '&Eacute;tudes de
moeurs.' the 'Scenes' describing Political and Military Life. In
the first group are five novels and stories: 'L'Envers de
l'histoire contemporaine' (The Under Side of Contemporary History,
a fine story, but rather social than political), 'Une
T&eacute;n&eacute;breuse affaire' (A Shady Affair), 'Un
&Eacute;pisode sous la Terreur,' 'Z. Marcas,' and 'Le Deput&eacute;
d'Arcis' (The Deputy of Arcis). Of these the 'Episode' is probably
the most admirable, although 'Z. Marcas' has not a little strength.
The 'Deput&eacute;,' like 'Les Petits bourgeois,' was continued by
M. Charles Rabou and a considerable part of it is not Balzac's; a
fact which is to be regretted, since practically it is the only one
of these stories that touches actual politics as the term is
usually understood. The military scenes are only two in number,
'Les Chouans' and 'Une Passion dans le d&eacute;sert.' The former
of these has been sufficiently described already; the latter is one
of the best known of the short stories, but rather deserves a place
beside 'La Fille aux yeux d'or.' Indeed, for Balzac's best military
scenes we must go to 'Le Colonel Chabert' or to 'Adieu.'</p>
<p>We now pass to those subterranean chambers of the great
structure we are exploring, the '&Eacute;tudes philosophiques.'
They are twenty in number, four being novels, one a composite
volume of tales, and the rest stories. The titles run as
follows:--'La Peau de chagrin,' 'L'&Eacute;lixir de longue vie'
(The Elixir of Life), 'Melmoth r&eacute;concili&eacute;,' 'Le
Chef-d'oeuvre inconnu' (The Anonymous Masterpiece), 'Gambara,'
'Massimila Doni,' 'Le R&eacute;quisitionnaire,' 'Adieu,' 'El
Verdugo,' 'Les Marana,' 'L'Auberge rouge' (The Red Inn), 'Un Drame
au bord de la mer' (A Seaside Drama), 'L'Enfant maudit' (A Child
Accursed) 'Ma&icirc;tre Corn&eacute;lius' (Master Cornelius), 'Sur
Catherine de M&eacute;dicis,' 'La Recherche de l'absolu,' 'Louis
Lambert,' 'S&eacute;raphita,' 'Les Proscrits,' and
'J&eacute;sus-Christ en Flandre.'</p>
<p>Of the novels, 'La Peau de chagrin' is easily first. Its central
theme is the world-old conflict between the infinite desires and
the finite powers of man. The hero, Raphael, is hardly, as M.
Barri&egrave;re asserts, on a level with Hamlet, Faust, and
Manfred, but the struggle of his infinite and his finite natures is
almost as intensely interesting as the similar struggles in them.
The introduction of the talisman, the wild ass's skin that
accomplishes all the wishes of its owner, but on condition that it
is to shrink away in proportion to the intensity of those wishes,
and that when it disappears the owner's life is to end, gave to the
story a weird interest not altogether, perhaps, in keeping with its
realistic setting, and certainly forcing a disastrous comparison
with the three great poems named. But when all allowances are made,
one is forced to conclude that 'La Peau de chagrin' is a novel of
extraordinary power and absorbing interest; and that its
description of its hero's dissipations in the libertine circles of
Paris, and its portrayal of the sublime devotion of the heroine
Pauline for her slowly perishing lover, are scarcely to be
paralleled in literature. Far less powerful are the short stories
on similar themes, entitled 'L'&Eacute;lixir de longue vie,' and
'Melmoth r&eacute;concili&eacute;' (Melmoth Reconciled), which give
us Balzac's rehandling of the Don Juan of Moli&egrave;re and Byron,
and the Melmoth of Maturin.</p>
<p>Below the 'Peau de chagrin,' but still among its author's best
novels, should be placed 'La Recherche de l'absolu,' which, as its
title implies, describes the efforts of a chemist to "prove by
chemical analysis the unity of composition of matter." In the
pursuit of his philosophic will-o'-the-wisp, Balthazar Cla&euml;s
loses his fortune and sacrifices his noble wife and children. His
madness serves, however, to bring into relief the splendid
qualities of these latter; and it is just here, in its human rather
than in its philosophic bearings, that the story rises to real
greatness. Marguerite Cla&euml;s, the daughter, is a noble heroine;
and if one wishes to see how Balzac's characters and ideas suffer
when treated by another though an able hand, one has but to read in
conjunction with this novel the 'Ma&icirc;tre Gu&eacute;rin' of the
distinguished dramatist &Eacute;mile Augier. A proper pendant to
this history of a noble genius perverted is 'La Confidence des
Ruggieri,' the second part of that remarkable composite 'Sur
Catherine de M&eacute;dicis,' a book which in spite of its mixture
of history, fiction, and speculative politics is one of the most
suggestive of Balzac's minor productions.</p>
<p>Concerning 'S&eacute;raphita' and 'Louis Lambert,' the remaining
novels of this series, certain noted mystics assert that they
contain the essence of Balzac's genius, and at least suggest the
secret of the universe. Perhaps an ordinary critic may content
himself with saying that both books are remarkable proofs of their
author's power, and that the former is notable for its marvelous
descriptions of Norwegian scenery.</p>
<p>Of the lesser members of the philosophic group, nearly all are
admirable in their kind and degree. 'Le Chef-d'oeuvre inconnu' and
'Gambara' treat of the pains of the artistic life and temperament.
'Massimila Doni,' like 'Gambara,' treats of music, but also gives a
brilliant picture of Venetian life. 'Le r&eacute;quisitionnaire,'
perhaps the best of Balzac's short stories, deals with the
phenomenon of second sight, as 'Adieu' does with that of mental
alienation caused by a sudden shock. 'Les Marana' is an absorbing
study of the effects of heredity; 'L'Auberge rouge' is an analysis
of remorse, as is also 'Un Drame au bord de la mer'; while
'L'Enfant maudit' is an analysis of the effects of extreme
sensibility, especially as manifested in the passion of poetic
love. Finally, 'Ma&icirc;tre Cornelius' is a study of avarice, in
which is set a remarkable portrait of Louis XI.; 'Les Proscrits' is
a masterly sketch of the exile of Dante at Paris; and
'J&eacute;sus-Christ en Flandre' is an exquisite allegory, the most
delicate flower, perhaps, of Balzac's genius.</p>
<p>It remains only to say a few words about the third division of
the 'Com&eacute;die humaine,' viz., the '&Eacute;tudes
analytiques.' Only two members of the series, the 'Physiologie du
mariage' and the 'Petites mis&egrave;res de la vie conjugale,' were
ever completed, and they are not great enough to make us regret the
loss of the 'Pathology of Social Life' and the other unwritten
volumes. For the two books we have are neither novels nor profound
studies, neither great fiction nor great psychology. That they are
worth reading for their suggestiveness with regard to such
important subjects as marriage and conjugal life goes without
saying, since they are Balzac's; but that they add greatly to his
reputation, not even his most ardent admirer would be hardy enough
to affirm.</p>
<p>And now in conclusion, what can one say about this great writer
that will not fall far short of his deserts? Plainly, nothing, yet
a few points may be accentuated with profit. We should notice in
the first place that Balzac has consciously tried almost every form
of prose fiction, and has been nearly always splendidly successful.
In analytic studies of high, middle, and low life he has not his
superior. In the novel of intrigue and sensation he is easily a
master, while he succeeds at least fairly in a form of fiction at
just the opposite pole from this, to wit, the idyl ('Le Lys dans la
vall&eacute;e'). In character sketches of extreme types, like
'Gobseck,' his supremacy has long been recognized, and he is almost
as powerful when he enters the world of mysticism, whither so few
of us can follow him. As a writer of novelettes he is unrivaled and
some of his short stories are worthy to rank with the best that his
followers have produced. In the extensive use of dialect he was a
pioneer; in romance he has 'La Peau de chagrin' and 'La Recherche
de l'absolu' to his credit; while some of the work in the tales
connected with the name of Catherine de Medici shows what he could
have done in historical fiction had he continued to follow Scott.
And what is true of the form of his fiction is true of its
elements. Tragedy, comedy, melodrama are all within his reach; he
can call up tears and shudders, laughter and smiles at will. He
knows the whole range of human emotions, and he dares to penetrate
into the arcana of passions almost too terrible or loathsome for
literature to touch.</p>
<p>In style, in the larger sense of the word, he is almost equally
supreme. He is the father of modern realism and remains its
greatest exponent. He retains always some of the good elements of
romance,--that is to say, he sees the thing as it ought to be,--and
he avoids the pitfalls of naturalism, being a painter and not a
photographer. In other words, like all truly great writers he never
forgets his ideals; but he is too impartial to his characters and
has too fast a grip on life to fall into the unrealities of
sentimentalism. It is true that he lacked the spontaneity that
characterized his great forerunner, Shakespeare, and his great
contemporary, George Sand; but this loss was made up by the
inevitable and impersonal character of his work when once his
genius was thoroughly aroused to action. His laborious method of
describing by an accumulation of details postponed the play of his
powers, which are at their height in the action of his characters;
yet sooner or later the inert masses of his composition were fused
into a burning whole. But if Balzac is primarily a dramatist in the
creation and manipulation of his characters, he is also a supreme
painter in his presentation of scenes. And what characters and what
scenes has he not set before us! Over two thousand personages move
through the 'Com&eacute;die humaine,' whose biographies MM.
Cerfberr and Christophe have collected for us in their admirable
'R&eacute;pertoire de la com&eacute;die humaine,' and whose chief
types M. Paul Flat has described in the first series of his 'Essais
sur Balzac.' Some of these personages are of course shadowy; but an
amazingly large number live for us as truly as Shakespeare's heroes
and heroines do. Nor will any one who has trod the streets of
Balzac's Paris, or spent the summer with him at the chateau des
Aigues ('Les Paysans'), or in the beautiful valleys of Touraine,
ever forget the master's pictures.</p>
<p>Yet the Balzac who with intangible materials created living and
breathing men and women and unfading scenes, has been accused of
vitiating the French language and has been denied the possession of
verbal style. On this point French critics must give the final
verdict; but a foreigner may cite Taine's defense of that style,
and maintain that most of the liberties taken by Balzac with his
native language were forced on him by the novel and far-reaching
character of his work. Nor should it be forgotten that he was
capable at times of almost perfect passages of description, and
that he rarely confounded, as novelists are too apt to do, the
provinces of poetry and prose.</p>
<p>But one might write a hundred essays on Balzac and not exhaust
him. One might write a volume on his women, a volume to refute the
charge that his bad men are better drawn than his good, a volume to
discuss Mr. Henry James's epigrammatic declaration that a
five-franc piece may be fairly called the protagonist of the
'Com&eacute;die humaine.' In short one might go on defending and
praising and even criticizing Balzac for a lifetime, and be little
further advanced than when one began; for to criticize Balzac, is
it not to criticize life itself?</p>

<h3>THE MEETING IN THE CONVENT</h3>
<center>From 'The Duchess of Langeais'</center>
<br>
<center><b>I</b></center>
<br>
<p>In a Spanish town on an island of the Mediterranean there is a
convent of the Barefooted Carmelites, where the rule of the Order
instituted by Saint Theresa is still kept with the primitive rigor
of the reformation brought about by that illustrious woman.
Extraordinary as this fact may seem, it is true. Though the
monasteries of the Peninsula and those of the Continent were nearly
all destroyed or broken up by the outburst of the French Revolution
and the turmoil of the Napoleonic wars, yet on this island,
protected by the British fleets, the wealthy convent and its
peaceful inmates were sheltered from the dangers of change and
general spoliation. The storms from all quarters which shook the
first fifteen years of the nineteenth century subsided ere they
reached this lonely rock near the coast of Andalusia. If the name
of the great Emperor echoed fitfully upon its shores, it may be
doubted whether the fantastic march of his glory or the flaming
majesty of his meteoric life ever reached the comprehension of
those saintly women kneeling in their distant cloister.</p>
<p>A conventual rigor, which was never relaxed, gave to this haven
a special place in the thoughts and history of the Catholic world.
The purity of its rule drew to its shelter from different parts of
Europe sad women, whose souls, deprived of human ties, longed for
the death in life which they found here in the bosom of God. No
other convent was so fitted to wean the heart and teach it that
aloofness from the things of this world which the religious life
imperatively demands. On the Continent may be found a number of
such Houses, nobly planned to meet the wants of their sacred
purpose. Some are buried in the depths of solitary valleys; others
hang, as it were, in mid-air above the hills, clinging to the
mountain slopes or projecting from the verge of precipices. On all
sides man has sought out the poesy of the infinite, the solemnity
of silence: he has sought God; and on the mountain-tops, in the
abysmal depths, among the caverned cliffs he has found Him. Yet
nowhere as on this European islet, half African though it be, can
he find such differing harmonies all blending to lift the soul and
quell its springs of anguish; to cool its fevers, and give to the
sorrows of life a bed of rest.</p>
<p>The monastery is built at the extremity of the island at its
highest part, where the rock by some convulsion of Nature has been
rent sharply down to the sea, and presents at all points keen
angles and edges, slightly eaten away at the water-line by the
action of the waves, but insurmountable to all approach. The rock
is also protected from assault by dangerous reefs running far out
from its base, over which frolic the blue waters of the
Mediterranean. It is only from the sea that the visitor can
perceive the four principal parts of the square structure, which
adheres minutely as to shape, height, and the piercing of its
windows to the prescribed laws of monastic architecture. On the
side towards the town the church hides the massive lines of the
cloister, whose roof is covered with large tiles to protect it from
winds and storms, and also from the fierce heat of the sun. The
church, the gift of a Spanish family, looks down upon the town and
crowns it. Its bold yet elegant fa&ccedil;ade gives a noble aspect
to the little maritime city. Is it not a picture of terrestrial
sublimity? See the tiny town with clustering roofs, rising like an
amphitheatre from the picturesque port upward to the noble Gothic
frontal of the church, from which spring the slender shafts of the
bell-towers with their pointed finials: religion dominating life:
offering to man the end and the way of living,--image of a thought
altogether Spanish. Place this scene upon the bosom of the
Mediterranean beneath an ardent sky; plant it with palms whose
waving fronds mingle their green life with the sculptured leafage
of the immutable architecture; look at the white fringes of the sea
as it runs up the reef and they sparkle upon the sapphire of its
wave; see the galleries and the terraces built upon the roofs of
houses, where the inhabitants come at eve to breathe the
flower-scented air as it rises through the tree-tops from their
little gardens. Below, in the harbor, are the white sails. The
serenity of night is coming on; listen to the notes of the organ,
the chant of evening orisons, the echoing bells of the ships at
sea: on all sides sound and peace,--oftenest peace.</p>
<p>Within the church are three naves, dark and mysterious. The fury
of the winds evidently forbade the architect to build out lateral
buttresses, such as adorn all other cathedrals, and between which
little chapels are usually constructed. Thus the strong walls which
flank the lesser naves shed no light into the building. Outside,
their gray masses are shored up from point to point by enormous
beams. The great nave and its two small lateral galleries are
lighted solely by the rose-window of stained glass, which pierces
with miraculous art the wall above the great portal, whose
fortunate exposure permits a wealth of tracery and dentellated
stone-work belonging to that order of architecture miscalled
Gothic.</p>
<p>The greater part of the three naves is given up to the
inhabitants of the town who come to hear Mass and the Offices of
the Church. In front of the choir is a latticed screen, within
which brown curtains hang in ample folds, slightly parted in the
middle to give a limited view of the altar and the officiating
priest. The screen is divided at intervals by pillars that hold up
a gallery within the choir which contains the organ. This
construction, in harmony with the rest of the building, continues,
in sculptured wood, the little columns of the lateral galleries
which are supported by the pillars of the great nave. Thus it is
impossible for the boldest curiosity, if any such should dare to
mount the narrow balustrade of these galleries, to see farther into
the choir than the octagonal stained windows which pierce the apse
behind the high altar.</p>
<p>At the time of the French expedition into Spain for the purpose
of re-establishing the authority of Ferdinand VII., and after the
fall of Cadiz, a French general who was sent to the island to
obtain its recognition of the royal government prolonged his stay
upon it that he might reconnoitre the convent and gain, if
possible, admittance there. The enterprise was a delicate one. But
a man of passion,--a man whose life had been, so to speak, a series
of poems in action, who had lived romances instead of writing them;
above all a man of deeds,--might well be tempted by a project
apparently so impossible. To open for himself legally the gates of
a convent of women! The Pope and the Metropolitan Archbishop would
scarcely sanction it. Should he use force or artifice? In case of
failure was he not certain to lose his station and his military
future, besides missing his aim? The Duc d'Angoul&ecirc;me was
still in Spain; and of all the indiscretions which an officer in
favor with the commander-in-chief could commit, this alone would be
punished without pity. The general had solicited his present
mission for the purpose of following up a secret hope, albeit no
hope was ever so despairing. This last effort, however, was a
matter of conscience. The house of these Barefooted Carmelites was
the only Spanish convent which had escaped his search. While
crossing from the mainland, a voyage which took less than an hour,
a strong presentiment of success had seized his heart. Since then,
although he had seen nothing of the convent but its walls, nothing
of the nuns, not so much as their brown habit; though he had heard
only the echoes of their chanted liturgies,--he had gathered from
those walls and from these chants faint indications that seemed to
justify his fragile hope. Slight as the auguries thus capriciously
awakened might be, no human passion was ever more violently roused
than the curiosity of this French general. To the heart there are
no insignificant events; it magnifies all things; it puts in the
same balance the fall of an empire and the fall of a woman's
glove,--and oftentimes the glove outweighs the empire. But let us
give the facts in their actual simplicity: after the facts will
come the feelings.</p>
<p>An hour after the expedition had landed on the island the royal
authority was re-established. A few Spaniards who had taken refuge
there after the fall of Cadiz embarked on a vessel which the
general allowed them to charter for their voyage to London. There
was thus neither resistance nor reaction. This little insular
restoration could not, however, be accomplished without a Mass, at
which both companies of the troops were ordered to be present. Not
knowing the rigor of the Carmelite rule, the general hoped to gain
in the church some information about the nuns who were immured in
the convent, one of whom might be a being dearer to him than life,
more precious even than honor. His hopes were at first cruelly
disappointed. Mass was celebrated with the utmost pomp. In honor of
this solemn occasion the curtains which habitually hid the choir
were drawn aside, and gave to view the rich ornaments, the
priceless pictures, and the shrines incrusted with jewels whose
brilliancy surpassed that of the votive offerings fastened by the
mariners of the port to the pillars of the great nave. The nuns,
however, had retired to the seclusion of the organ gallery.</p>
<p>Yet in spite of this check, and while the Mass of thanksgiving
was being sung, suddenly and secretly the drama widened into an
interest as profound as any that ever moved the heart of man. The
Sister who played the organ roused an enthusiasm so vivid that not
one soldier present regretted the order which had brought him to
the church. The men listened to the music with pleasure; the
officers were carried away by it. As for the general, he remained
to all appearance calm and cold: the feelings with which he heard
the notes given forth by the nun are among the small number of
earthly things whose expression is withheld from impotent human
speech, but which--like death, like God, like eternity--can be
perceived only at their slender point of contact with the heart of
man. By a strange chance the music of the organ seemed to be that
of Rossini,--a composer who more than any other has carried human
passion into the art of music, and whose works by their number and
extent will some day inspire an Homeric respect. From among the
scores of this fine genius the nun seemed to have chiefly studied
that of Moses in Egypt; doubtless because the feelings of sacred
music are there carried to the highest pitch. Perhaps these two
souls--one so gloriously European, the other unknown--had met
together in some intuitive perception of the same poetic thought.
This idea occurred to two officers now present, true
<i>dilettanti</i>, who no doubt keenly regretted the Th&eacute;atre
Favart in their Spanish exile. At last, at the Te Deum, it was
impossible not to recognize a French soul in the character which
the music suddenly took on. The triumph of his Most Christian
Majesty evidently roused to joy the heart of that cloistered nun.
Surely she was a Frenchwoman. Presently the patriotic spirit burst
forth, sparkling like a jet of light through the antiphonals of the
organ, as the Sister recalled melodies breathing the delicacy of
Parisian taste, and blended them with vague memories of our
national anthems. Spanish hands could not have put into this
graceful homage paid to victorious arms the fire that thus betrayed
the origin of the musician.</p>
<p>"France is everywhere!" said a soldier.</p>
<p>The general left the church during the Te Deum; it was
impossible for him to listen to it. The notes of the musician
revealed to him a woman loved to madness; who had buried herself so
deeply in the heart of religion, hid herself so carefully away from
the sight of the world, that up to this time she had escaped the
keen search of men armed not only with immense power, but with
great sagacity and intelligence. The hopes which had wakened in the
general's heart seemed justified as he listened to the vague echo
of a tender and melancholy air, 'La Fleuve du Tage,'--a ballad
whose prelude he had often heard in Paris in the boudoir of the
woman he loved, and which this nun now used to express, amid the
joys of the conquerors, the suffering of an exiled heart. Terrible
moment! to long for the resurrection of a lost love; to find that
love--still lost; to meet it mysteriously after five years in which
passion, exasperated by the void, had been intensified by the
useless efforts made to satisfy it.</p>
<p>Who is there that has not, once at least in his life, upturned
everything about him, his papers and his receptacles, taxing his
memory impatiently as he seeks some precious lost object; and then
felt the ineffable pleasure of finding it after days consumed in
the search, after hoping and despairing of its recovery,--spending
upon some trifle an excitement of mind almost amounting to a
passion? Well, stretch this fury of search through five long years;
put a woman, a heart, a love in the place of the insignificant
trifle; lift the passion into the highest realms of feeling; and
then picture to yourself an ardent man, a man with the heart of
lion and the front of Jove, one of those men who command, and
communicate to those about them, respectful terror,--you will then
understand the abrupt departure of the general during the Te Deum,
at the moment when the prelude of an air, once heard in Paris with
delight under gilded ceilings, vibrated through the dark naves of
the church by the sea.</p>
<p>He went down the hilly street which led up to the convent,
without pausing until the sonorous echoes of the organ could no
longer reach his ear. Unable to think of anything but of the love
that like a volcanic eruption rent his heart, the French general
only perceived that the Te Deum was ended when the Spanish
contingent poured from the church. He felt that his conduct and
appearance were open to ridicule, and he hastily resumed his place
at the head of the cavalcade, explaining to the alcalde and to the
governor of the town that a sudden indisposition had obliged him to
come out into the air. Then it suddenly occurred to him to use the
pretext thus hastily given, as a means of prolonging his stay on
the island. Excusing himself on the score of increased illness, he
declined to preside at the banquet given by the authorities of the
island to the French officers, and took to his bed, after writing
to the major-general that a passing illness compelled him to turn
over his command to the colonel. This commonplace artifice, natural
as it was, left him free from all duties and able to seek the
fulfilment of his hopes. Like a man essentially Catholic and
monarchical, he inquired the hours of the various services, and
showed the utmost interest in the duties of religion,--a piety
which in Spain excited no surprise.</p>
<br>
<center><b>II</b></center>
<br>
<p>The following day, while the soldiers were embarking, the
general went up to the convent to be present at vespers. He found
the church deserted by the townspeople, who in spite of their
natural devotion were attracted to the port by the embarkation of
the troops. The Frenchman, glad to find himself alone in the
church, took pains to make the clink of his spurs resound through
the vaulted roof; he walked noisily, and coughed, and spoke aloud
to himself, hoping to inform the nuns, but especially the Sister at
the organ, that if the French soldiers were departing, one at least
remained behind. Was this singular method of communication heard
and understood? The general believed it was. In the Magnificat the
organ seemed to give an answer which came to him in the vibrations
of the air. The soul of the nun floated towards him on the wings of
the notes she touched, quivering with the movements of the sound.
The music burst forth with power; it glorified the church. This
hymn of joy, consecrated by the sublime liturgy of Roman
Christianity to the uplifting of the soul in presence of the
splendors of the ever-living God, became the utterance of a heart
terrified at its own happiness in presence of the splendors of a
perishable love, which still lived, and came to move it once more
beyond the tomb where this woman had buried herself, to rise again
the bride of Christ.</p>
<p>The organ is beyond all question the finest, the most daring,
the most magnificent of the instruments created by human genius. It
is an orchestra in itself, from which a practiced hand may demand
all things; for it expresses all things. Is it not, as it were, a
coign of vantage, where the soul may poise itself ere it springs
into space, bearing, as it flies, the listening mind through a
thousand scenes of life towards the infinite which parts earth from
heaven? The longer a poet listens to its gigantic harmonies, the
more fully will he comprehend that between kneeling humanity and
the God hidden by the dazzling rays of the Holy of Holies, the
hundred voices of terrestrial choirs can alone bridge the vast
distance and interpret to Heaven the prayers of men in all the
omnipotence of their desires, in the diversities of their woe, with
the tints of their meditations and their ecstasies, with the
impetuous spring of their repentance, and the thousand imaginations
of their manifold beliefs. Yes! beneath these soaring vaults the
harmonies born of the genius of sacred things find a yet unheard-of
grandeur, which adorns and strengthens them. Here the dim light,
the deep silence, the voices alternating with the solemn tones of
the organ, seem like a veil through which the luminous attributes
of God himself pierce and radiate. Yet all these sacred riches now
seem flung like a grain of incense on the frail altar of an earthly
love, in presence of the eternal throne of a jealous and avenging
Deity. The joy of the nun had not the gravity which properly
belongs to the solemnity of the Magnificat. She gave to the music
rich and graceful modulations, whose rhythms breathed of human
gayety; her measures ran into the brilliant cadences of a great
singer striving to express her love, and the notes rose buoyantly
like the carol of a bird by the side of its mate. At moments she
darted back into the past, as if to sport there or to weep there
for an instant. Her changing moods had something discomposed about
them, like the agitations of a happy woman rejoicing at the return
of her lover. Then, as these supple strains of passionate emotion
ceased, the soul that spoke returned upon itself; the musician
passed from the major to the minor key, and told her hearer the
story of her present. She revealed to him her long melancholy, the
slow malady of her moral being,--every day a feeling crushed, every
night a thought subdued, hour by hour a heart burning down to
ashes. After soft modulations the music took on slowly, tint by
tint, the hue of deepest sadness. Soon it poured forth in echoing
torrents the well-springs of grief, till suddenly the higher notes
struck clear like the voice of angels, as if to tell to her lost
love--lost, but not forgotten--that the reunion of their souls must
be in heaven, and only there: hope most precious! Then came the
Amen. In that no joy, no tears, nor sadness, nor regrets, but a
return to God. The last chord that sounded was grave, solemn,
terrible. The musician revealed the nun in the garb of her
vocation; and as the thunder of the basses rolled away, causing the
hearer to shudder through his whole being, she seemed to sink into
the tomb from which for a brief moment she had risen. As the echoes
slowly ceased to vibrate along the vaulted roofs, the church, made
luminous by the music, fell suddenly into profound obscurity.</p>
<p>The general, carried away by the course of this powerful genius,
had followed her, step by step, along her way. He comprehended in
their full meaning the pictures that gleamed through that burning
symphony; for him those chords told all. For him, as for the
Sister, this poem of sound was the future, the past, the present.
Music, even the music of an opera, is it not to tender and poetic
souls, to wounded and suffering hearts, a text which they interpret
as their memories need? If the heart of a poet must be given to a
musician, must not poetry and love be listeners ere the great
musical works of art are understood? Religion, love, and music: are
they not the triple expression of one fact, the need of expansion,
the need of touching with their own infinite the infinite beyond
them, which is in the fibre of all noble souls? These three forms
of poesy end in God, who alone can unwind the knot of earthly
emotion. Thus this holy human trinity joins itself to the holiness
of God, of whom we make to ourselves no conception unless we
surround him by the fires of love and the golden cymbals of music
and light and harmony.</p>
<p>The French general divined that on this desert rock, surrounded
by the surging seas, the nun had cherished music to free her soul
of the excess of passion that consumed it. Did she offer her love
as a homage to God? Did the love triumph over the vows she had made
to Him? Questions difficult to answer. But, beyond all doubt, the
lover had found in a heart dead to the world a love as passionate
as that which burned within his own.</p>
<p>When vespers ended he returned to the house of the alcalde,
where he was quartered. Giving himself over, a willing prey, to the
delights of a success long expected, laboriously sought, his mind
at first could dwell on nothing else,--he was still loved. Solitude
had nourished the love of that heart, just as his own had thriven
on the barriers, successively surmounted, which this woman had
placed between herself and him. This ecstasy of the spirit had its
natural duration; then came the desire to see this woman, to
withdraw her from God, to win her back to himself,--a bold project,
welcome to a bold man. After the evening repast, he retired to his
room to escape questions and think in peace, and remained plunged
in deep meditation throughout the night. He rose early and went to
Mass. He placed himself close to the latticed screen, his brow
touching the brown curtain. He longed to rend it away; but he was
not alone, his host had accompanied him, and the least imprudence
might compromise the future of his love and ruin his new-found
hopes. The organ was played, but not by the same hand; the musician
of the last two days was absent from its key-board. All was chill
and pale to the general. Was his mistress worn out by the emotions
which had wellnigh broken down his own vigorous heart? Had she so
truly shared and comprehended his faithful and eager love that she
now lay exhausted and dying in her cell? At the moment when such
thoughts as these rose in the general's mind, he heard beside him
the voice beloved; he knew the clear ring of its tones. The voice,
slightly changed by a tremor which gave it the timid grace and
modesty of a young girl, detached itself from the volume of song,
like the voice of a prima donna in the harmonies of her final
notes. It gave to the ear an impression like the effect to the eye
of a fillet of silver or gold threading a dark frieze. It was
indeed she! Still Parisian, she had not lost her gracious charm,
though she had forsaken the coronet and adornments of the world for
the frontlet and serge of a Carmelite. Having revealed her love the
night before in the praises addressed to the Lord of all, she
seemed now to say to her lover:--"Yes, it is I: I am here. I love
forever; yet I am aloof from love. Thou shalt hear me; my soul
shall enfold thee; but I must stay beneath the brown shroud of this
choir, from which no power can tear me. Thou canst not see me."</p>
<p>"It is she!" whispered the general to himself, as he raised his
head and withdrew his hands from his face; for he had not been able
to bear erect the storm of feeling that shook his heart as the
voice vibrated through the arches and blended with the murmur of
the waves. A storm raged without, yet peace was within the
sanctuary. The rich voice still caressed the ear, and fell like
balm upon the parched heart of the lover; it flowered in the air
about him, from which he breathed the emanations of her spirit
exhaling her love through the aspirations of its prayer.</p>
<p>The alcalde came to rejoin his guest, and found him bathed in
tears at the elevation of the Host which was chanted by the nun.
Surprised to find such devotion in a French officer, he invited the
confessor of the convent to join them at supper, and informed the
general, to whom no news had ever given such pleasure, of what he
had done. During the supper the general made the confessor the
object of much attention, and thus confirmed the Spaniards in the
high opinion they had formed of his piety. He inquired with grave
interest the number of the nuns, and asked details about the
revenues of the convent and its wealth, with the air of a man who
politely wished to choose topics which occupied the mind of the
good old priest. Then he inquired about the life led by the
sisters. Could they go out? Could they see friends?</p>
<p>"Senhor," said the venorable priest, "the rule is severe. If the
permission of our Holy Father must be obtained before a woman can
enter a house of Saint Bruno [the Chartreux] the like rule exists
here. It is impossible for any man to enter a convent of the
Bare-footed Carmelites, unless he is a priest delegated by the
archbishop for duty in the House. No nun can go out. It is true,
however, that the Great Saint, Mother Theresa, did frequently leave
her cell. A Mother-superior can alone, under authority of the
archbishop, permit a nun to see her friends, especially in case of
illness. As this convent is one of the chief Houses of the Order,
it has a Mother-superior residing in it. We have several
foreigners,--among them a Frenchwoman, Sister Theresa, the one who
directs the music in the chapel."</p>
<p>"Ah!" said the general, feigning surprise: "she must have been
gratified by the triumph of the House of Bourbon?"</p>
<p>"I told them the object of the Mass; they are always rather
curious."</p>
<p>"Perhaps Sister Theresa has some interests in France; she might
be glad to receive some news, or ask some questions?"</p>
<p>"I think not; or she would have spoken to me."</p>
<p>"As a compatriot," said the general, "I should be curious to
see--that is, if it were possible, if the superior would consent,
if--"</p>
<p>"At the grating, even in the presence of the reverend Mother, an
interview would be absolutely impossible for any ordinary man, no
matter who he was; but in favor of a liberator of a Catholic throne
and our holy religion, possibly, in spite of the rigid rule of our
Mother Theresa, the rule might be relaxed," said the confessor. "I
will speak about it."</p>
<p>"How old is Sister Theresa?" asked the lover, who dared not
question the priest about the beauty of the nun.</p>
<p>"She is no longer of any age," said the good old man, with a
simplicity which made the general shudder.</p>
<br>
<center><b>III</b></center>
<br>
<p>The next day, before the <i>siesta</i>, the confessor came to
tell the general that Sister Theresa and the Mother-superior
consented to receive him at the grating that evening before the
hour of vespers. After the <i>siesta</i>, during which the
Frenchman had whiled away the time by walking round the port in the
fierce heat of the sun, the priest came to show him the way into
the convent.</p>
<p>He was guided through a gallery which ran the length of the
cemetery, where fountains and trees and numerous arcades gave a
cool freshness in keeping with that still and silent spot. When
they reached the end of this long gallery, the priest led his
companion into a parlor, divided in the middle by a grating covered
with a brown curtain. On the side which we must call public, and
where the confessor left the general, there was a wooden bench
along one side of the wall; some chairs, also of wood, were near
the grating. The ceiling was of wood, crossed by heavy beams of the
evergreen oak, without ornament. Daylight came from two windows in
the division set apart for the nuns, and was absorbed by the brown
tones of the room; so that it barely showed the picture of the
great black Christ, and those of Saint Theresa and the Blessed
Virgin, which hung on the dark panels of the walls.</p>
<p>The feelings of the general turned, in spite of their violence,
to a tone of melancholy. He grew calm in these calm precincts.
Something mighty as the grave seized him beneath these chilling
rafters. Was it not the eternal silence, the deep peace, the near
presence of the infinite? Through the stillness came the fixed
thought of the cloister,--that thought which glides through the air
in the half-lights, and is in all things,--the thought
unchangeable; nowhere seen, which yet grows vast to the
imagination; the all-comprising phrase, <i>the peace of God</i>. It
enters there, with living power, into the least religious heart.
Convents of men are not easily conceivable; man seems feeble and
unmanly in them. He is born to act, to fulfil a life of toil; and
he escapes it in his cell. But in a monastery of women what
strength to endure, and yet what touching weakness! A man may be
pushed by a thousand sentiments into the depths of an abbey; he
flings himself into them as from a precipice. But the woman is
drawn only by one feeling; she does not unsex herself,--she
espouses holiness. You may say to the man, Why did you not
struggle? but to the cloistered woman life is a struggle still.</p>
<p>The general found in this mute parlor of the seagirt convent
memories of himself. Love seldom reaches upward to solemnity; but
love in the bosom of God,--is there nothing solemn there? Yes, more
than a man has the right to hope for in this nineteenth century,
with our manners and our customs what they are.</p>
<p>The general's soul was one on which such impressions act. His
nature was noble enough to forget self-interest, honors, Spain, the
world, or Paris, and rise to the heights of feeling roused by this
unspeakable termination of his long pursuit. What could be more
tragic? How many emotions held these lovers, reunited at last on
this granite ledge far out at sea, yet separated by an idea, an
impassable barrier. Look at this man, saying to himself, "Can I
triumph over God in that heart?"</p>
<p>A slight noise made him quiver. The brown curtain was drawn
back; he saw in the half-light a woman standing, but her face was
hidden from him by the projection of a veil, which lay in many
folds upon her head. According to the rule of the Order she was
clothed in the brown garb whose color has become proverbial. The
general could not see the naked feet, which would have told him the
frightful emaciation of her body; yet through the thick folds of
the coarse robe that swathed her, his heart divined that tears and
prayers and passion and solitude had wasted her away.</p>
<p>The chill hand of a woman, doubtless the Mother-superior, held
back the curtain, and the general, examining this unwelcome witness
of the interview, encountered the deep grave eyes of an old nun,
very aged, whose clear, even youthful, glance belied the wrinkles
that furrowed her pale face.</p>
<p>"Madame la duchesse," he said, in a voice shaken by emotion, to
the Sister, who bowed her head, "does your companion understand
French?"</p>
<p>"There is no duchess here," replied the nun. "You are in
presence of Sister Theresa. The woman whom you call my companion is
my Mother in God, my superior here below."</p>
<p>These words, humbly uttered by a voice that once harmonized with
the luxury and elegance in which this woman had lived queen of the
world of Paris, that fell from lips whose language had been of old
so gay, so mocking, struck the general as if with an electric
shock.</p>
<p>"My holy Mother speaks only Latin and Spanish," she added.</p>
<p>"I understand neither. Dear Antoinette, make her my
excuses."</p>
<p>As she heard her name softly uttered by a man once so hard to
her, the nun was shaken by emotion, betrayed only by the light
quivering of her veil, on which the light now fully fell.</p>
<p>"My brother," she said, passing her sleeve beneath her veil,
perhaps to wipe her eyes, "my name is Sister Theresa."</p>
<p>Then she turned to the Mother, and said to her in Spanish a few
words which the general plainly heard. He knew enough of the
language to understand it, perhaps to speak it. "My dear Mother,
this gentleman presents to you his respects, and begs you to excuse
him for not laying them himself at your feet; but he knows neither
of the languages which you speak."</p>
<p>The old woman slowly bowed her head; her countenance took an
expression of angelic sweetness, tempered, nevertheless, by the
consciousness of her power and dignity.</p>
<p>"You know this gentleman?" she asked, with a piercing glance at
the Sister.</p>
<p>"Yes, my Mother."</p>
<p>"Retire to your cell, my daughter," said the Superior in a tone
of authority.</p>
<p>The general hastily withdrew to the shelter of the curtain, lest
his face should betray the anguish these words cost him; but he
fancied that the penetrating eyes of the Superior followed him even
into the shadow. This woman, arbiter of the frail and fleeting joy
he had won at such cost, made him afraid; he trembled, he whom a
triple range of cannon could not shake.</p>
<p>The duchess walked to the door, but there she turned. "My
Mother," she said, in a voice horribly calm, "this Frenchman is one
of my brothers."</p>
<p>"Remain, therefore, my daughter," said the old woman, after a
pause.</p>
<p>The jesuitism of this answer revealed such love and such regret,
that a man of less firmness than the general would have betrayed
his joy in the midst of a peril so novel to him. But what value
could there be in the words, looks, gestures of a love that must be
hidden from the eyes of a lynx, the claws of a tiger? The Sister
came back.</p>
<p>"You see, my brother," she said, "what I have dared to do that I
might for one moment speak to you of your salvation, and tell you
of the prayers which day by day my soul offers to heaven on your
behalf. I have committed a mortal sin,--I have lied. How many days
of penitence to wash out that lie! But I shall suffer for you. You
know not, my brother, the joy of loving in heaven, of daring to
avow affections that religion has purified, that have risen to the
highest regions, that at last we know and feel with the soul alone.
If the doctrines--if the spirit of the saint to whom we owe this
refuge had not lifted me above the anguish of earth to a world, not
indeed where she is, but far above my lower life, I could not have
seen you now. But I can see you, I can hear you, and remain
calm."</p>
<p>"Antoinette," said the general, interrupting these words,
"suffer me to see you--you, whom I love passionately, to madness,
as you once would have had me love you."</p>
<p>"Do not call me Antoinette, I implore you: memories of the past
do me harm. See in me only the Sister Theresa, a creature trusting
all to the divine pity. And," she added, after a pause, "subdue
yourself, my brother. Our Mother would separate us instantly if
your face betrayed earthly passions, or your eyes shed tears."</p>
<p>The general bowed his head, as if to collect himself; when he
again lifted his eyes to the grating he saw between two bars the
pale, emaciated, but still ardent face of the nun. Her complexion,
where once had bloomed the loveliness of youth,--where once there
shone the happy contrast of a pure, clear whiteness with the colors
of a Bengal rose,--now had the tints of a porcelain cup through
which a feeble light showed faintly. The beautiful hair of which
this woman was once so proud was shaven; a white band bound her
brows and was wrapped around her face. Her eyes, circled with dark
shadows due to the austerities of her life, glanced at moments with
a feverish light, of which their habitual calm was but the mask. In
a word, of this woman nothing remained but her soul.</p>
<p>"Ah! you will leave this tomb--you, who are my life! You
belonged to me; you were not free to give yourself--not even to
God. Did you not promise to sacrifice all to the least of my
commands? Will you now think me worthy to claim that promise, if I
tell you what I have done for your sake? I have sought you through
the whole world. For five years you have been the thought of every
instant, the occupation of every hour, of my life. My
friends--friends all-powerful as you know--have helped me to search
the convents of France, Spain, Italy, Sicily, America. My love has
deepened with every fruitless search. Many a long journey I have
taken on a false hope. I have spent my life and the strong beatings
of my heart about the walls of cloisters. I will not speak to you
of a fidelity unlimited. What is it?--nothing compared to the
infinitude of my love! If in other days your remorse was real, you
cannot hesitate to follow me now."</p>
<p>"You forget that I am not free."</p>
<p>"The duke is dead," he said hastily.</p>
<p>Sister Theresa colored. "May Heaven receive him!" she said, with
quick emotion: "he was generous to me. But I did not speak of those
ties: one of my faults was my willingness to break them without
scruple for you."</p>
<p>"You speak of your vows," cried the general, frowning. "I little
thought that anything would weigh in your heart against our love.
But do not fear, Antoinette; I will obtain a brief from the Holy
Father which will absolve your vows. I will go to Rome; I will
petition every earthly power; if God himself came down from heaven
I--"</p>
<p>"Do not blaspheme!"</p>
<p>"Do not fear how God would see it! Ah! I wish I were as sure
that you will leave these walls with me; that to-night--to-night,
you would embark at the feet of these rocks. Let us go to find
happiness! I know not where--at the ends of the earth! With me you
will come back to life, to health--in the shelter of my love!"</p>
<p>"Do not say these things," replied the Sister; "you do not know
what you now are to me. I love you better than I once loved you. I
pray to God for you daily. I see you no longer with the eyes of my
body. If you but knew, Armand, the joy of being able, without
shame, to spend myself upon a pure love which God protects! You do
not know the joy I have in calling down the blessings of heaven
upon your head. I never pray for myself: God will do with me
according to his will. But you--at the price of my eternity I would
win the assurance that you are happy in this world, that you will
be happy in another throughout the ages. My life eternal is all
that misfortunes have left me to give you. I have grown old in
grief; I am no longer young or beautiful. Ah! you would despise a
nun who returned to be a woman; no sentiment, not even maternal
love, could absolve her. What could you say to me that would shake
the unnumbered reflections my heart has made in five long
years,--and which have changed it, hollowed it, withered it? Ah! I
should have given something less sad to God!"</p>
<p>"What can I say to you, dear Antoinette? I will say that I love
you; that affection, love, true love, the joy of living in a heart
all ours,--wholly ours, without one reservation,--is so rare, so
difficult to find, that I once doubted you; I put you to cruel
tests. But to-day I love and trust you with all the powers of my
soul. If you will follow me I will listen throughout life to no
voice but thine. I will look on no face--"</p>
<p>"Silence, Armand! you shorten the sole moments which are given
to us to see each other here below."</p>
<p>"Antoinette! will you follow me?"</p>
<p>"I never leave you. I live in your heart--but with another power
than that of earthly pleasure, or vanity, or selfish joy. I live
here for you, pale and faded, in the bosom of God. If God is just,
you will be happy."</p>
<p>"Phrases! you give me phrases! But if I will to have you pale
and faded,--if I cannot be happy unless you are with me? What! will
you forever place duties before my love? Shall I never be above all
things else in your heart? In the past you put the world, or
self--I know not what--above me; to-day it is God, it is my
salvation. In this Sister Theresa I recognize the duchess; ignorant
of the joys of love, unfeeling beneath a pretense of tenderness!
You do not love me! you never loved me!--"</p>
<p>"Oh, my brother!--"</p>
<p>"You will not leave this tomb. You love my soul, you say: well!
you shall destroy it forever and ever. I will kill myself--"</p>
<p>"My Mother!" cried the nun, "I have lied to you; this man is my
lover."</p>
<p>The curtain fell. The general, stunned, heard the doors close
with violence.</p>
<p>"She loves me still!" he cried, comprehending all that was
revealed in the cry of the nun. "I will find means to carry her
away!"</p>
<p>He left the island immediately, and returned to France.</p>

<h3>'AN EPISODE UNDER THE TERROR'</h3>
<p>On the 22d of January, 1793, towards eight o'clock in the
evening, an old gentlewoman came down the sharp declivity of the
Faubourg Saint-Martin, which ends near the church of Saint-Laurent
in Paris. Snow had fallen throughout the day, so that footfalls
could be scarcely heard. The streets were deserted. The natural
fear inspired by such stillness was deepened by the terror to which
all France was then a prey.</p>
<p>The old lady had met no one. Her failing sight hindered her from
perceiving in the distance a few pedestrians, sparsely scattered
like shadows, along the broad road of the faubourg. She was walking
bravely through the solitude as if her age were a talisman to guard
her from danger; but after passing the Rue des Morts she fancied
that she heard the firm, heavy tread of a man coming behind her.
The thought seized her mind that she had been listening to it
unconsciously for some time. Terrified at the idea of being
followed, she tried to walk faster to reach a lighted shop-window,
and settle the doubt which thus assailed her. When well beyond the
horizontal rays of light thrown across the pavement, she turned
abruptly and saw a human form looming through the fog. The
indistinct glimpse was enough. She staggered for an instant under
the weight of terror, for she no longer doubted that this unknown
man had tracked her, step by step, from her home. The hope of
escaping such a spy lent strength to her feeble limbs. Incapable of
reasoning, she quickened her steps to a run, as if it were possible
to escape a man necessarily more agile than she. After running for
a few minutes, she reached the shop of a pastry-cook, entered it,
and fell, rather than sat, down on a chair which stood before the
counter.</p>
<p>As she lifted the creaking latch of the door, a young woman, who
was at work on a piece of embroidery, looked up and recognized
through the glass panes the antiquated mantle of purple silk which
wrapped the old lady, and hastened to pull open a drawer, as if to
take from thence something that she had to give her. The action and
the expression of the young woman not only implied a wish to get
rid of the stranger, as of some one most unwelcome, but she let
fall an exclamation of impatience at finding the drawer empty.
Then, without looking at the lady, she came rapidly from behind the
counter, and went towards the back-shop to call her husband, who
appeared at once.</p>
<p>"Where have you put ---- ----?" she asked him, mysteriously,
calling his attention to the old lady by a glance, and not
concluding her sentence.</p>
<p>Although the pastry-cook could see nothing but the enormous
black-silk hood circled with purple ribbons which the stranger
wore, he disappeared, with a glance at his wife which seemed to
say, "Do you suppose I should leave <i>that</i> on your
counter?"</p>
<p>Surprised at the silence and immobility of her customer, the
wife came forward, and was seized with a sudden movement of
compassion as well as of curiosity when she looked at her. Though
the complexion of the old gentlewoman was naturally livid, like
that of a person vowed to secret austerities, it was easy to see
that some recent alarm had spread an unusual paleness over her
features. Her head-covering was so arranged as to hide the hair,
whitened no doubt by age, for the cleanly collar of her dress
proved that she wore no powder. The concealment of this natural
adornment gave to her countenance a sort of conventual severity;
but its features were grave and noble. In former days the habits
and manners of people of quality were so different from those of
all other classes that it was easy to distinguish persons of noble
birth. The young shop-woman felt certain, therefore, that the
stranger was a <i>ci-devant</i>, and one who had probably belonged
to the court.</p>
<p>"Madame?" she said, with involuntary respect, forgetting that
the title was proscribed.</p>
<p>The old lady made no answer. Her eyes were fixed on the glass of
the shop-window, as if some alarming object were painted upon
it.</p>
<p>"What is the matter, <i>citoyenne</i>?" asked the master of the
establishment, re-entering, and drawing the attention of his
customer to a little cardboard box covered with blue paper, which
he held out to her.</p>
<p>"It is nothing, nothing, my friends," she answered in a gentle
voice, as she raised her eyes to give the man a thankful look.
Seeing a phrygian cap upon his head, a cry escaped her:--"Ah! it is
you who have betrayed me!"</p>
<p>The young woman and her husband replied by a deprecating gesture
of horror which caused the unknown lady to blush, either for her
harsh suspicion or from the relief of feeling it unjust.</p>
<p>"Excuse me," she said, with childlike sweetness. Then taking a
gold <i>louis</i> from her pocket, she offered it to the
pastry-cook. "Here is the sum we agreed upon," she added.</p>
<p>There is a poverty which poor people quickly divine. The
shopkeeper and his wife looked at each other with a glance at the
old lady that conveyed a mutual thought. The <i>louis</i> was
doubtless her last. The hands of the poor woman trembled as she
offered it, and her eyes rested upon it sadly, yet not with
avarice. She seemed to feel the full extent of her sacrifice.
Hunger and want were traced upon her features in lines as legible
as those of timidity and ascetic habits. Her clothing showed
vestiges of luxury. It was of silk, well-worn; the mantle was
clean, though faded; the laces carefully darned; in short, here
were the rags of opulence. The two shopkeepers, divided between
pity and self-interest, began to soothe their conscience with
words:--</p>
<p>"<i>Citoyenne</i>, you seem very feeble--"</p>
<p>"Would Madame like to take something?" asked the wife, cutting
short her husband's speech.</p>
<p>"We have some very good broth," he added.</p>
<p>"It is so cold, perhaps Madame is chilled by her walk; but you
can rest here and warm yourself."</p>
<p>"The devil is not so black as he is painted," cried the
husband.</p>
<p>Won by the kind tone of these words, the old lady admitted that
she had been followed by a man and was afraid of going home
alone.</p>
<p>"Is that all?" said the man with the phrygian cap. "Wait for me,
<i>citoyenne</i>."</p>
<p>He gave the <i>louis</i> to his wife. Then moved by a species of
gratitude which slips into the shopkeeping soul when its owner
receives an exorbitant price for an article of little value, he
went to put on his uniform as a National guard, took his hat, slung
on his sabre, and reappeared under arms. But the wife meantime had
reflected. Reflection, as often happens in many hearts, had closed
the open hand of her benevolence. Uneasy, and alarmed lest her
husband should be mixed up in some dangerous affair, she pulled him
by the flap of his coat, intending to stop him; but the worthy man,
obeying the impulse of charity, promptly offered to escort the poor
lady to her home.</p>
<p>"It seems that the man who has given her this fright is prowling
outside," said his wife nervously.</p>
<p>"I am afraid he is," said the old lady, with much
simplicity.</p>
<p>"Suppose he should be a spy. Perhaps it is a conspiracy. Don't
go. Take back the box." These words, whispered in the pastry-cook's
ear by the wife of his bosom, chilled the sudden compassion that
had warmed him.</p>
<p>"Well, well, I will just say two words to the man and get rid of
him," he said, opening the door and hurrying out.</p>
<p>The old gentlewoman, passive as a child and half paralyzed with
fear, sat down again. The shopkeeper almost instantly reappeared;
but his face, red by nature and still further scorched by the fires
of his bakery, had suddenly turned pale, and he was in the grasp of
such terror that his legs shook and his eyes were like those of a
drunken man.</p>
<p>"Miserable aristocrat!" he cried, furiously, "do you want to cut
off our heads? Go out from here; let me see your heels, and don't
dare to come back; don't expect me to supply you with the means of
conspiracy!"</p>
<p>So saying, the pastry-cook endeavored to get back the little box
which the old lady had already slipped into one of her pockets.
Hardly had the bold hands of the shopkeeper touched her clothing,
than, preferring to encounter danger with no protection but that of
God rather than lose the thing she had come to buy, she recovered
the agility of youth, and sprang to the door, through which she
disappeared abruptly, leaving the husband and wife amazed and
trembling.</p>
<p>As soon as the poor lady found herself alone in the street she
began to walk rapidly; but her strength soon gave way, for she once
more heard the snow creaking under the footsteps of the spy as he
trod heavily upon it. She was obliged to stop short: the man
stopped also. She dared not speak to him, nor even look at him;
either because of her terror, or from some lack of natural
intelligence. Presently she continued her walk slowly; the man
measured his step by hers, and kept at the same distance behind
her; he seemed to move like her shadow. Nine o'clock struck as the
silent couple repassed the church of Saint-Laurent. It is the
nature of all souls, even the weakest, to fall back into quietude
after moments of violent agitation; for manifold as our feelings
may be, our bodily powers are limited. Thus the old lady, receiving
no injury from her apparent persecutor, began to think that he
might be a secret friend watching to protect her. She gathered up
in her mind the circumstances attending other apparitions of the
mysterious stranger as if to find plausible grounds for this
consoling opinion, and took pleasure in crediting him with good
rather than sinister intentions. Forgetting the terror he had
inspired in the pastry-cook, she walked on with a firmer step
towards the upper part of the Faubourg Saint-Martin.</p>
<p>At the end of half an hour she reached a house standing close to
the junction of the chief street of the faubourg with the street
leading out to the Barri&egrave;re de Pantin. The place is to this
day one of the loneliest in Paris. The north wind blowing from
Belleville and the Buttes Chaumont whistled among the houses, or
rather cottages, scattered through the sparsely inhabited little
valley, where the inclosures are fenced with walls built of mud and
refuse bones. This dismal region seems the natural home of poverty
and despair. The man who was intent on following the poor creature
who had had the courage to thread these dark and silent streets
seemed struck with the spectacle they offered. He stopped as if
reflecting, and stood in a hesitating attitude, dimly visible by a
street lantern whose flickering light scarcely pierced the fog.
Fear gave eyes to the old gentlewoman, who now fancied that she saw
something sinister in the features of this unknown man. All her
terrors revived, and profiting by the curious hesitation that had
seized him, she glided like a shadow to the doorway of the solitary
dwelling, touched a spring, and disappeared with phantasmagoric
rapidity.</p>
<p>The man, standing motionless, gazed at the house, which was, as
it were, a type of the wretched buildings of the neighborhood. The
tottering hovel, built of porous stone in rough blocks, was coated
with yellow plaster much cracked, and looked ready to fall before a
gust of wind. The roof, of brown tiles covered with moss, had sunk
in several places, and gave the impression that the weight of snow
might break it down at any moment. Each story had three windows
whose frames, rotted by dampness and shrunken by the heat of the
sun, told that the outer cold penetrated to the chambers. The
lonely house seemed like an ancient tower that time had forgotten
to destroy. A faint light gleamed from the garret windows, which
were irregularly cut in the roof; but the rest of the house was in
complete obscurity. The old woman went up the rough and clumsy
stairs with difficulty, holding fast to a rope which took the place
of baluster. She knocked furtively at the door of a lodging under
the roof, and sat hastily down on a chair which an old man offered
her.</p>
<p>"Hide! hide yourself!" she cried. "Though we go out so seldom,
our errands are known, our steps are watched--"</p>
<p>"What has happened?" asked another old woman sitting near the
fire.</p>
<p>"The man who has hung about the house since yesterday followed
me to-night."</p>
<p>At these words the occupants of the hovel looked at each other
with terror in their faces. The old man was the least moved of the
three, possibly because he was the one in greatest danger. Under
the pressure of misfortune or the yoke of persecution a man of
courage begins, as it were, by preparing for the sacrifice of
himself: he looks upon his days as so many victories won from fate.
The eyes of the two women, fixed upon the old man, showed plainly
that he alone was the object of their extreme anxiety.</p>
<p>"Why distrust God, my sisters?" he said, in a hollow but
impressive voice. "We chanted praises to his name amid the cries of
victims and assassins at the convent. If it pleased him to save me
from that butchery, it was doubtless for some destiny which I shall
accept without a murmur. God protects his own, and disposes of them
according to his will. It is of you, not of me, that we should
think."</p>
<p>"No," said one of the women: "what is our life in comparison
with that of a priest?"</p>
<p>"Ever since the day when I found myself outside of the Abbaye
des Chelles," said the nun beside the fire, "I have given myself up
for dead."</p>
<p>"Here," said the one who had just come in, holding out the
little box to the priest, "here are the sacramental
wafers--Listen!" she cried, interrupting herself. "I hear some one
on the stairs."</p>
<p>At these words all three listened intently. The noise
ceased.</p>
<p>"Do not be frightened," said the priest, "even if some one asks
to enter. A person on whose fidelity we can safely rely has taken
measures to cross the frontier, and he will soon call here for
letters which I have written to the Duc de Langeais and the Marquis
de Beaus&eacute;ant, advising them as to the measures they must
take to get you out of this dreadful country, and save you from the
misery or the death you would otherwise undergo here."</p>
<p>"Shall you not follow us?" said the two nuns softly, but in a
tone of despair.</p>
<p>"My place is near the victims," said the priest, simply.</p>
<p>The nuns were silent, looking at him with devout admiration.</p>
<p>"Sister Martha," he said, addressing the nun who had fetched the
wafers, "this messenger must answer '<i>Fiat voluntas</i>' to the
word '<i>Hosanna</i>.'"</p>
<p>"There is some one on the stairway," exclaimed the other nun,
hastily opening a hiding-place burrowed at the edge of the
roof.</p>
<p>This time it was easy to hear the steps of a man sounding
through the deep silence on the rough stairs, which were caked with
patches of hardened mud. The priest slid with difficulty into a
narrow hiding-place, and the nuns hastily threw articles of apparel
over him.</p>
<p>"You can shut me in, Sister Agatha," he said, in a smothered
voice.</p>
<p>He was scarcely hidden when three knocks upon the door made the
sisters tremble and consult each other with their eyes, for they
dared not speak. Forty years' separation from the world had made
them like plants of a hot-house which wilt when brought into the
outer air. Accustomed to the life of a convent, they could not
conceive of any other; and when one morning their bars and gratings
were flung down, they had shuddered at finding themselves free. It
is easy to imagine the species of imbecility which the events of
the Revolution, enacted before their eyes, had produced in these
innocent souls. Quite incapable of harmonizing their conventual
ideas with the exigencies of ordinary life, not even comprehending
their own situation, they were like children who had always been
cared for, and who now, torn from their maternal providence, had
taken to prayers as other children take to tears. So it happened
that in presence of immediate danger they were dumb and passive,
and could think of no other defence than Christian resignation.</p>
<p>The man who sought to enter interpreted their silence as he
pleased; he suddenly opened the door and showed himself. The two
nuns trembled when they recognized the individual who for some days
had watched the house and seemed to make inquiries about its
inmates. They stood quite still and looked at him with uneasy
curiosity, like the children of savages examining a being of
another sphere. The stranger was very tall and stout, but nothing
in his manner or appearance denoted that he was a bad man. He
copied the immobility of the sisters and stood motionless, letting
his eye rove slowly round the room.</p>
<p>Two bundles of straw placed on two planks served as beds for the
nuns. A table was in the middle of the room; upon it a copper
candlestick, a few plates, three knives, and a round loaf of bread.
The fire on the hearth was very low, and a few sticks of wood piled
in a corner of the room testified to the poverty of the occupants.
The walls, once covered with a coat of paint now much defaced,
showed the wretched condition of the roof through which the rain
had trickled, making a network of brown stains. A sacred relic,
saved no doubt from the pillage of the Abbaye des Chelles, adorned
the mantel-shelf of the chimney. Three chairs, two coffers, and a
broken chest of drawers completed the furniture of the room. A
doorway cut near the fireplace showed there was probably an inner
chamber.</p>
<p>The inventory of this poor cell was soon made by the individual
who had presented himself under such alarming auspices. An
expression of pity crossed his features, and as he threw a kind
glance upon the frightened women he seemed as much embarrassed as
they. The strange silence in which they all three stood and faced
each other lasted but a moment; for the stranger seemed to guess
the moral weakness and inexperience of the poor helpless creatures,
and he said, in a voice which he strove to render gentle, "I have
not come as an enemy, <i>citoyennes</i>."</p>
<p>Then he paused, but resumed:--"My sisters, if harm should ever
happen to you, be sure that I shall not have contributed to it. I
have come to ask a favor of you."</p>
<p>They still kept silence.</p>
<p>"If I ask too much--if I annoy you--I will go away; but believe
me, I am heartily devoted to you, and if there is any service that
I could render you, you may employ me without fear. I, and I alone,
perhaps, am above law--since there is no longer a king."</p>
<p>The ring of truth in these words induced Sister Agatha, a nun
belonging to the ducal house of Langeais, and whose manners
indicated that she had once lived amid the festivities of life and
breathed the air of courts, to point to a chair as if she asked
their guest to be seated. The unknown gave vent to an expression of
joy, mingled with melancholy, as he understood this gesture. He
waited respectfully till the sisters were seated, and then obeyed
it.</p>
<p>"You have given shelter," he said, "to a venerable priest not
sworn in by the Republic, who escaped miraculously from the
massacre at the Convent of the Carmelites."</p>
<p>"<i>Hosanna</i>," said Sister Agatha, suddenly interrupting the
stranger, and looking at him with anxious curiosity.</p>
<p>"That is not his name, I think," he answered.</p>
<p>"But, Monsieur, we have no priest here," cried Sister Martha,
hastily, "and--"</p>
<p>"Then you should take better precautions," said the unknown
gently, stretching his arm to the table and picking up a breviary.
"I do not think you understand Latin, and--"</p>
<p>He stopped short, for the extreme distress painted on the faces
of the poor nuns made him fear he had gone too far; they trembled
violently, and their eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>"Do not fear," he said; "I know the name of your guest, and
yours also. During the last three days I have learned your poverty,
and your great devotion to the venerable Abb&eacute; of--"</p>
<p>"Hush!" exclaimed Sister Agatha, ingenuously putting a finger on
her lip.</p>
<p>"You see, my sisters, that if I had the horrible design of
betraying you, I might have accomplished it again and again."</p>
<p>As he uttered these words the priest emerged from his prison and
appeared in the middle of the room.</p>
<p>"I cannot believe, Monsieur," he said courteously, "that you are
one of our persecutors. I trust you. What is it you desire of
me?"</p>
<p>The saintly confidence of the old man, and the nobility of mind
imprinted on his countenance, might have disarmed even an assassin.
He who thus mysteriously agitated this home of penury and
resignation stood contemplating the group before him; then he
addressed the priest in a trustful tone, with these words:--</p>
<p>"My father, I came to ask you to celebrate a mass for the repose
of the soul--of--of a sacred being whose body can never lie in holy
ground."</p>
<p>The priest involuntarily shuddered. The nuns, not as yet
understanding who it was of whom the unknown man had spoken, stood
with their necks stretched and their faces turned towards the
speakers, in an attitude of eager curiosity. The ecclesiastic
looked intently at the stranger; unequivocal anxiety was marked on
every feature, and his eyes offered an earnest and even ardent
prayer.</p>
<p>"Yes," said the priest at length. "Return here at midnight, and
I shall be ready to celebrate the only funeral service that we are
able to offer in expiation of the crime of which you speak."</p>
<p>The unknown shivered; a joy both sweet and solemn seemed to rise
in his soul above some secret grief. Respectfully saluting the
priest and the two saintly women, he disappeared with a mute
gratitude which these generous souls knew well how to
interpret.</p>
<p>Two hours later the stranger returned, knocked cautiously at the
door of the garret, and was admitted by Mademoiselle de Langeais,
who led him to the inner chamber of the humble refuge, where all
was in readiness for the ceremony. Between two flues of the chimney
the nuns had placed the old chest of drawers, whose broken edges
were concealed by a magnificent altar-cloth of green moir&eacute;.
A large ebony and ivory crucifix hanging on the discolored wall
stood out in strong relief from the surrounding bareness, and
necessarily caught the eye. Four slender little tapers, which the
sisters had contrived to fasten to the altar with sealing-wax,
threw a pale glimmer dimly reflected by the yellow wall. These
feeble rays scarcely lit up the rest of the chamber, but as their
light fell upon the sacred objects it seemed a halo falling from
heaven upon the bare and undecorated altar.</p>
<p>The floor was damp. The attic roof, which sloped sharply on both
sides of the room, was full of chinks through which the wind
penetrated. Nothing could be less stately, yet nothing was ever
more solemn than this lugubrious ceremony. Silence so deep that
some far-distant cry could have pierced it, lent a sombre majesty
to the nocturnal scene. The grandeur of the occasion contrasted
vividly with the poverty of its circumstances, and roused a feeling
of religious terror. On either side of the altar the old nuns,
kneeling on the tiled floor and taking no thought of its mortal
dampness, were praying in concert with the priest, who, robed in
his pontifical vestments, placed upon the altar a golden chalice
incrusted with precious stones,--a sacred vessel rescued, no doubt,
from the pillage of the Abbaye des Chelles. Close to this vase,
which was a gift of royal munificence, the bread and wine of the
consecrated sacrifice were contained in two glass tumblers scarcely
worthy of the meanest tavern. In default of a missal the priest had
placed his breviary on a corner of the altar. A common earthenware
platter was provided for the washing of those innocent hands, pure
and unspotted with blood. All was majestic and yet paltry; poor but
noble; profane and holy in one.</p>
<p>The unknown man knelt piously between the sisters. Suddenly, as
he caught sight of the crape upon the chalice and the
crucifix,--for in default of other means of proclaiming the object
of this funeral rite the priest had put God himself into
mourning,--the mysterious visitant was seized by some all-powerful
recollection, and drops of sweat gathered on his brow. The four
silent actors in this scene looked at each other with mysterious
sympathy; their souls, acting one upon another, communicated to
each the feelings of all, blending them into the one emotion of
religious pity. It seemed as though their thought had evoked from
the dead the sacred martyr whose body was devoured by quicklime,
but whose shade rose up before them in royal majesty. They were
celebrating a funeral Mass without the remains of the deceased.
Beneath these rafters and disjointed laths four Christian souls
were interceding with God for a king of France, and making his
burial without a coffin. It was the purest of all devotions; an act
of wonderful loyalty accomplished without one thought of self.
Doubtless in the eyes of God it was the cup of cold water that
weighed in the balance against many virtues. The whole of monarchy
was there in the prayers of the priest and the two poor women; but
also it may have been that the Revolution was present likewise, in
the person of the strange being whose face betrayed the remorse
that led him to make this solemn offering of a vast repentance.</p>
<p>Instead of pronouncing the Latin words, "Introibo ad altare Dei"
etc., the priest, with divine intuition, glanced at his three
assistants, who represented all Christian France, and said, in
words which effaced the penury and meanness of the hovel, "We enter
now into the sanctuary of God."</p>
<p>At these words, uttered with penetrating unction, a solemn awe
seized the participants. Beneath the dome of St. Peter's in Rome,
God had never seemed more majestic to man than he did now in this
refuge of poverty and to the eyes of these Christians,--so true is
it that between man and God all mediation is unneeded, for his
glory descends from himself alone. The fervent piety of the
nameless man was unfeigned, and the feeling that held these four
servants of God and the king was unanimous. The sacred words echoed
like celestial music amid the silence. There was a moment when the
unknown broke down and wept: it was at the Pater Noster, to which
the priest added a Latin clause which the stranger doubtless
comprehended and applied,--"Et remitte scelus regicidis sicut
Ludovicus eis remisit semetipse" (And forgive the regicides even as
Louis XVI. himself forgave them). The two nuns saw the tears
coursing down the manly cheeks of their visitant, and dropping fast
on the tiled floor.</p>
<p>The Office of the Dead was recited. The "Domine salvum fac
regem," sung in low tones, touched the hearts of these faithful
royalists as they thought of the infant king, now captive in the
hands of his enemies, for whom this prayer was offered. The unknown
shuddered; perhaps he feared an impending crime in which he would
be called to take an unwilling part.</p>
<p>When the service was over, the priest made a sign to the nuns,
who withdrew to the outer room. As soon as he was alone with the
unknown, the old man went up to him with gentle sadness of manner,
and said in the tone of a father,--</p>
<p>"My son, if you have steeped your hands in the blood of the
martyr king, confess yourself to me. There is no crime which, in
the eyes of God, is not washed out by a repentance as deep and
sincere as yours appears to be."</p>
<p>At the first words of the ecclesiastic an involuntary motion of
terror escaped the stranger; but he quickly recovered himself, and
looked at the astonished priest with calm assurance.</p>
<p>"My father," he said, in a voice that nevertheless trembled, "no
one is more innocent than I of the blood shed--"</p>
<p>"I believe it!" said the priest.</p>
<p>He paused a moment, during which he examined afresh his
penitent; then, persisting in the belief that he was one of those
timid members of the Assembly who sacrificed the inviolate and
sacred head to save their own, he resumed in a grave voice:--</p>
<p>"Reflect, my son, that something more than taking no part in
that great crime is needed to absolve from guilt. Those who kept
their sword in the scabbard when they might have defended their
king have a heavy account to render to the King of kings. Oh, yes,"
added the venerable man, moving his head from right to left with an
expressive motion; "yes, heavy, indeed! for, standing idle, they
made themselves the accomplices of a horrible transgression."</p>
<p>"Do you believe," asked the stranger, in a surprised tone, "that
even an indirect participation will be punished? The soldier
ordered to form the line--do you think he was guilty?"</p>
<p>The priest hesitated. Glad of the dilemma that placed this
puritan of royalty between the dogma of passive obedience, which
according to the partisans of monarchy should dominate the military
system, and the other dogma, equally imperative, which consecrates
the person of the king, the stranger hastened to accept the
hesitation of the priest as a solution of the doubts that seemed to
trouble him. Then, so as not to allow the old Jansenist time for
further reflection, he said quickly:--</p>
<p>"I should blush to offer you any fee whatever in acknowledgment
of the funeral service you have just celebrated for the repose of
the king's soul and for the discharge of my conscience. We can only
pay for inestimable things by offerings which are likewise beyond
all price. Deign to accept, Monsieur, the gift which I now make to
you of a holy relic; the day may come when you will know its
value."</p>
<p>As he said these words he gave the ecclesiastic a little box of
light weight. The priest took it as it were involuntarily; for the
solemn tone in which the words were uttered, and the awe with which
the stranger held the box, struck him with fresh amazement. They
re-entered the outer room, where the two nuns were waiting for
them.</p>
<p>"You are living," said the unknown, "in a house whose owner,
Mucius Scaevola, the plasterer who lives on the first floor, is
noted in the Section for his patriotism. He is, however, secretly
attached to the Bourbons. He was formerly huntsman to Monseigneur
the Prince de Conti, to whom he owes everything. As long as you
stay in this house you are in greater safety than you can be in any
other part of France. Remain here. Pious souls will watch over you
and supply your wants; and you can await without danger the coming
of better days. A year hence, on the 21st of January" (as he
uttered these last words he could not repress an involuntary
shudder), "I shall return to celebrate once more the Mass of
expiation--"</p>
<p>He could not end the sentence. Bowing to the silent occupants of
the garret, he cast a last look upon the signs of their poverty and
disappeared.</p>
<p>To the two simple-minded women this event had all the interest
of a romance. As soon as the venerable abb&eacute; told them of the
mysterious gift so solemnly offered by the stranger, they placed
the box upon the table, and the three anxious faces, faintly
lighted by a tallow-candle, betrayed an indescribable curiosity.
Mademoiselle de Langeais opened the box and took from it a
handkerchief of extreme fineness, stained with sweat. As she
unfolded it they saw dark stains.</p>
<p>"That is blood!" exclaimed the priest.</p>
<p>"It is marked with the royal crown!" cried the other nun.</p>
<p>The sisters let fall the precious relic with gestures of horror.
To these ingenuous souls the mystery that wrapped their unknown
visitor became inexplicable, and the priest from that day forth
forbade himself to search for its solution.</p>
<p>The three prisoners soon perceived that, in spite of the Terror,
a powerful arm was stretched over them. First, they received
firewood and provisions; next, the sisters guessed that a woman was
associated with their protector, for linen and clothing came to
them mysteriously, and enabled them to go out without danger of
observation from the aristocratic fashion of the only garments they
had been able to secure; finally, Mucius Scaevola brought them
certificates of citizenship. Advice as to the necessary means of
insuring the safety of the venerable priest often came to them from
unexpected quarters, and proved so singularly opportune that it was
quite evident it could only have been given by some one in
possession of state secrets. In spite of the famine which then
afflicted Paris, they found daily at the door of their hovel
rations of white bread, laid there by invisible hands. They thought
they recognized in Mucius Scaevola the agent of these mysterious
benefactions, which were always timely and intelligent; but the
noble occupants of the poor garret had no doubt whatever that the
unknown individual who had celebrated the midnight Mass on the 22d
of January, 1793, was their secret protector. They added to their
daily prayers a special prayer for him; night and day these pious
hearts made supplication for his happiness, his prosperity, his
redemption. They prayed that God would keep his feet from snares
and save him from his enemies, and grant him a long and peaceful
life.</p>
<p>Their gratitude, renewed as it were daily, was necessarily
mingled with curiosity that grew keener day by day. The
circumstances attending the appearance of the stranger were a
ceaseless topic of conversation and of endless conjecture, and soon
became a benefit of a special kind, from the occupation and
distraction of mind which was thus produced. They resolved that the
stranger should not be allowed to escape the expression of their
gratitude when he came to commemorate the next sad anniversary of
the death of Louis XVI.</p>
<p>That night, so impatiently awaited, came at length. At midnight
the heavy steps resounded up the wooden stairway. The room was
prepared for the service; the altar was dressed. This time the
sisters opened the door and hastened to light the entrance.
Mademoiselle de Langeais even went down a few stairs that she might
catch the first glimpse of their benefactor.</p>
<p>"Come!" she said, in a trembling and affectionate voice. "Come,
you are expected!"</p>
<p>The man raised his head, gave the nun a gloomy look, and made no
answer. She felt as though an icy garment had fallen upon her, and
she kept silence. At his aspect gratitude and curiosity died within
their hearts. He may have been less cold, less taciturn, less
terrible than he seemed to these poor souls, whose own emotions led
them to expect a flow of friendship from his. They saw that this
mysterious being was resolved to remain a stranger to them, and
they acquiesced with resignation. But the priest fancied he saw a
smile, quickly repressed, upon the stranger's lip as he saw the
preparations made to receive him. He heard the Mass and prayed, but
immediately disappeared, refusing in a few courteous words the
invitation given by Mademoiselle de Langeais to remain and partake
of the humble collation they had prepared for him.</p>
<p>After the 9th Thermidor the nuns and the Abb&eacute; de Marolles
were able to go about Paris without incurring any danger. The first
visit of the old priest was to a perfumery at the sign of the
"Queen of Flowers," kept by the citizen and <i>citoyenne</i> Ragon,
formerly perfumers to the Court, well known for their faithfulness
to the royal family, and employed by the Vend&eacute;ens as a
channel of communication with the princes and royal committees in
Paris. The abb&eacute;, dressed as the times required, was leaving
the doorstep of the shop, situated between the church of Saint-Roch
and the Rue des Fondeurs, when a great crowd coming down the Rue
Saint-Honor&eacute; hindered him from advancing.</p>
<p>"What is it?" he asked of Madame Ragon.</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing!" she answered. "It is the cart and the executioner
going to the Place Louis XV. Ah, we saw enough of that last year!
but now, four days after the anniversary of the 21st of January, we
can look at the horrid procession without distress."</p>
<p>"Why so?" asked the abb&eacute;. "What you say is not
Christian."</p>
<p>"But this is the execution of the accomplices of Robespierre.
They have fought it off as long as they could, but now they are
going in their turn where they have sent so many innocent
people."</p>
<p>The crowd which filled the Rue Saint-Honor&eacute; passed on
like a wave. Above the sea of heads the Abb&eacute; de Marolles,
yielding to an impulse, saw, standing erect in the cart, the
stranger who three days before had assisted for the second time in
the Mass of commemoration.</p>
<p>"Who is that?" he asked; "the one standing--"</p>
<p>"That is the executioner," answered Monsieur Ragon, calling the
man by his monarchical name.</p>
<p>"Help! help!" cried Madame Ragon. "Monsieur l'Abb&eacute; is
fainting!"</p>
<p>She caught up a flask of vinegar and brought him quickly back to
consciousness.</p>
<p>"He must have given me," said the old priest, "the handkerchief
with which the king wiped his brow as he went to his martyrdom.
Poor man! that steel knife had a heart when all France had
none!"</p>
<p>The perfumers thought the words of the priest were an effect of
delirium.</p>

<h3>A PASSION IN THE DESERT</h3>
<p>"The sight was fearful!" she exclaimed, as we left the menagerie
of Monsieur Martin.</p>
<p>She had been watching that daring speculator as he went through
his wonderful performance in the den of the hyena.</p>
<p>"How is it possible," she continued, "to tame those animals so
as to be certain that he can trust them?"</p>
<p>"You think it a problem," I answered, interrupting her, "and yet
it is a natural fact."</p>
<p>"Oh!" she cried, an incredulous smile flickering on her lip.</p>
<p>"Do you think that beasts are devoid of passions?" I asked. "Let
me assure you that we teach them all the vices and virtues of our
own state of civilization."</p>
<p>She looked at me in amazement.</p>
<p>"The first time I saw Monsieur Martin," I added, "I exclaimed,
as you do, with surprise. I happened to be sitting beside an old
soldier whose right leg was amputated, and whose appearance had
attracted my notice as I entered the building. His face, stamped
with the scars of battle, wore the undaunted look of a veteran of
the wars of Napoleon. Moreover, the old hero had a frank and joyous
manner which attracts me wherever I meet it. He was doubtless one
of those old campaigners whom nothing can surprise, who find
something to laugh at in the last contortions of a comrade, and
will bury a friend or rifle his body gayly; challenging bullets
with indifference; making short shrift for themselves or others;
and fraternizing, as a usual thing, with the devil. After looking
very attentively at the proprietor of the menagerie as he entered
the den, my companion curled his lip with that expression of
satirical contempt which well-informed men sometimes put on to mark
the difference between themselves and dupes. As I uttered my
exclamation of surprise at the coolness and courage of Monsieur
Martin, the old soldier smiled, shook his head, and said with a
knowing glance, 'An old story!'</p>
<p>"'How do you mean an old story?' I asked. 'If you could explain
the secret of this mysterious power, I should be greatly obliged to
you.'</p>
<p>"After a while, during which we became better acquainted, we
went to dine at the first cafe we could find after leaving the
menagerie. A bottle of champagne with our dessert brightened the
old man's recollections and made them singularly vivid. He related
to me a circumstance in his early history which proved that he had
ample cause to pronounce Monsieur Martin's performance 'an old
story.'"</p>
<p>When we reached her house, she was so persuasive and
captivating, and made me so many pretty promises, that I consented
to write down for her benefit the story told me by the old hero. On
the following day I sent her this episode of a historical epic,
which might be entitled, 'The French in Egypt.'</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>At the time of General Desaix's expedition to Upper Egypt a
Proven&ccedil;al soldier, who had fallen into the hands of the
Maugrabins, was marched by those tireless Arabs across the desert
which lies beyond the cataracts of the Nile. To put sufficient
distance between themselves and the French army, the Maugrabins
made a forced march and did not halt until after nightfall. They
then camped about a well shaded with palm-trees, near which they
had previously buried a stock of provisions. Not dreaming that the
thought of escape could enter their captive's mind, they merely
bound his wrists, and lay down to sleep themselves, after eating a
few dates and giving their horses a feed of barley. When the bold
Proven&ccedil;al saw his enemies too soundly asleep to watch him,
he used his teeth to pick up a scimitar, with which, steadying the
blade by means of his knees, he contrived to cut through the cord
which bound his hands, and thus recovered his liberty. He at once
seized a carbine and a poniard, took the precaution to lay in a
supply of dates, a small bag of barley, some powder and ball,
buckled on the scimitar, mounted one of the horses, and spurred him
in the direction where he supposed the French army to be. Impatient
to meet the outposts, he pressed the horse, which was already
wearied, so severely that the poor animal fell dead with his flanks
torn, leaving the Frenchman alone in the midst of the desert.</p>
<p>After marching for a long time through the sand with the dogged
courage of an escaping galley-slave, the soldier was forced to
halt, as darkness drew on: for his utter weariness compelled him to
rest, though the exquisite sky of an eastern night might well have
tempted him to continue the journey. Happily he had reached a
slight elevation, at the top of which a few palm-trees shot upward,
whose leafage, seen from a long distance against the sky, had
helped to sustain his hopes. His fatigue was so great that he threw
himself down on a block of granite, cut by Nature into the shape of
a camp-bed, and slept heavily, without taking the least precaution
to protect himself while asleep. He accepted the loss of his life
as inevitable, and his last waking thought was one of regret for
having left the Maugrabins, whose nomad life began to charm him now
that he was far away from them and from every other hope of
succor.</p>
<p>He was awakened by the sun, whose pitiless beams falling
vertically upon the granite rock produced an intolerable heat. The
Proven&ccedil;al had ignorantly flung himself down in a contrary
direction to the shadows thrown by the verdant and majestic fronds
of the palm-trees. He gazed at these solitary monarchs and
shuddered. They recalled to his mind the graceful shafts, crowned
with long weaving leaves, which distinguish the Saracenic columns
of the cathedral of Arles. The thought overcame him, and when,
after counting the trees, he threw his eyes upon the scene around
him, an agony of despair convulsed his soul. He saw a limitless
ocean. The sombre sands of the desert stretched out till lost to
sight in all directions; they glittered with dark lustre like a
steel blade shining in the sun. He could not tell if it were an
ocean or a chain of lakes that lay mirrored before him. A hot vapor
swept in waves above the surface of this heaving continent. The sky
had the Oriental glow of translucent purity, which disappoints
because it leaves nothing for the imagination to desire. The
heavens and the earth were both on fire. Silence added its awful
and desolate majesty. Infinitude, immensity pressed down upon the
soul on every side; not a cloud in the sky, not a breath in the
air, not a rift on the breast of the sand, which was ruffled only
with little ridges scarcely rising above its surface. Far as the
eye could reach the horizon fell away into space, marked by a
slender line, slim as the edge of a sabre,--like as in summer seas
a thread of light parts this earth from the heaven it meets.</p>
<p>The Proven&ccedil;al clasped the trunk of a palm-tree as if it
were the body of a friend. Sheltered from the sun by its straight
and slender shadow, he wept; and presently sitting down he remained
motionless, contemplating with awful dread the implacable Nature
stretched out before him. He cried aloud, as if to tempt the
solitude to answer him. His voice, lost in the hollows of the
hillock, sounded afar with a thin resonance that returned no echo;
the echo came from the soldier's heart. He was twenty-two years
old, and he loaded his carbine.</p>
<p>"Time enough!" he muttered, as he put the liberating weapon on
the sand beneath him.</p>
<p>Gazing by turns at the burnished blackness of the sand and the
blue expanse of the sky, the soldier dreamed of France. He smelt in
fancy the gutters of Paris; he remembered the towns through which
he had passed, the faces of his comrades, and the most trifling
incidents of his life. His southern imagination saw the pebbles of
his own Provence in the undulating play of the heated air, as it
seemed to roughen the far-reaching surface of the desert. Dreading
the dangers of this cruel mirage, he went down the little hill on
the side opposite to that by which he had gone up the night before.
His joy was great when he discovered a natural grotto, formed by
the immense blocks of granite which made a foundation for the
rising ground. The remnants of a mat showed that the place had once
been inhabited, and close to the entrance were a few palm-trees
loaded with fruit. The instinct which binds men to life woke in his
heart. He now hoped to live until some Maugrabin should pass that
way; possibly he might even hear the roar of cannon, for Bonaparte
was at that time overrunning Egypt. Encouraged by these thoughts,
the Frenchman shook down a cluster of the ripe fruit under the
weight of which the palms were bending; and as he tasted this
unhoped-for manna, he thanked the former inhabitant of the grotto
for the cultivation of the trees, which the rich and luscious flesh
of the fruit amply attested. Like a true Proven&ccedil;al, he
passed from the gloom of despair to a joy that was half insane. He
ran back to the top of the hill, and busied himself for the rest of
the day in cutting down one of the sterile trees which had been his
shelter the night before.</p>
<p>Some vague recollection made him think of the wild beasts of the
desert, and foreseeing that they would come to drink at a spring
which bubbled through the sand at the foot of the rock, he resolved
to protect his hermitage by felling a tree across the entrance.
Notwithstanding his eagerness, and the strength which the fear of
being attacked while asleep gave to his muscles, he was unable to
cut the palm-tree in pieces during the day; but he succeeded in
bringing it down. Towards evening the king of the desert fell; and
the noise of his fall, echoing far, was like a moan from the breast
of Solitude. The soldier shuddered, as though he had heard a voice
predicting evil. But, like an heir who does not long mourn a
parent, he stripped from the beautiful tree the arching green
fronds--its poetical adornment--and made a bed of them in his
refuge. Then, tired with his work and by the heat of the day, he
fell asleep beneath the red vault of the grotto.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night his sleep was broken by a strange
noise. He sat up; the deep silence that reigned everywhere enabled
him to hear the alternating rhythm of a respiration whose savage
vigor could not belong to a human being. A terrible fear, increased
by the darkness, by the silence, by the rush of his waking fancies,
numbed his heart. He felt the contraction of his hair, which rose
on end as his eyes, dilating to their full strength, beheld through
the darkness two faint amber lights. At first he thought them an
optical delusion; but by degrees the clearness of the night enabled
him to distinguish objects in the grotto, and he saw, within two
feet of him, an enormous animal lying at rest.</p>
<p>Was it a lion? Was it a tiger? Was it a crocodile? The
Proven&ccedil;al had not enough education to know in what
sub-species he ought to class the intruder; but his terror was all
the greater because his ignorance made it vague. He endured the
cruel trial of listening, of striving to catch the peculiarties of
this breathing without losing one of its inflections, and without
daring to make the slightest movement. A strong odor, like that
exhaled by foxes, only far more pungent and penetrating, filled the
grotto. When the soldier had tasted it, so to speak, by the nose,
his fear became terror; he could no longer doubt the nature of the
terrible companion whose royal lair he had taken for a bivouac.
Before long, the reflection of the moon, as it sank to the horizon,
lighted up the den and gleamed upon the shining, spotted skin of a
panther.</p>
<p>The lion of Egypt lay asleep, curled up like a dog, the
peaceable possessor of a kennel at the gate of a mansion; its eyes,
which had opened for a moment, were now closed; its head was turned
towards the Frenchman. A hundred conflicting thoughts rushed
through the mind of the panther's prisoner. Should he kill it with
a shot from his musket? But ere the thought was formed, he saw
there was no room to take aim; the muzzle would have gone beyond
the animal. Suppose he were to wake it? The fear kept him
motionless. As he heard the beating of his heart through the dead
silence, he cursed the strong pulsations of his vigorous blood,
lest they should disturb the sleep which gave him time to think and
plan for safety. Twice he put his hand on his scimitar, with the
idea of striking off the head of his enemy; but the difficulty of
cutting through the close-haired skin made him renounce the bold
attempt. Suppose he missed his aim? It would, he knew, be certain
death. He preferred the chances of a struggle, and resolved to
await the dawn. It was not long in coming. As daylight broke, the
Frenchman was able to examine the animal. Its muzzle was stained
with blood. "It has eaten a good meal," thought he, not caring
whether the feast were human flesh or not; "it will not be hungry
when it wakes."</p>
<p>It was a female. The fur on the belly and on the thighs was of
sparkling whiteness. Several little spots like velvet made pretty
bracelets round her paws. The muscular tail was also white, but it
terminated with black rings. The fur of the back, yellow as dead
gold and very soft and glossy, bore the characteristic spots,
shaded like a full-blown rose, which distinguish the panther from
all other species of <i>felis</i>. This terrible hostess lay
tranquilly snoring, in an attitude as easy and graceful as that of
a cat on the cushions of an ottoman. Her bloody paws, sinewy and
well-armed, were stretched beyond her head, which lay upon them;
and from her muzzle projected a few straight hairs called whiskers,
which shimmered in the early light like silver wires.</p>
<p>If he had seen her lying thus imprisoned in a cage, the
Proven&ccedil;al would have admired the creature's grace, and the
strong contrasts of vivid color which gave to her robe an imperial
splendor; but as it was, his sight was jaundiced by sinister
forebodings. The presence of the panther, though she was still
asleep, had the same effect upon his mind as the magnetic eyes of a
snake produce, we are told, upon the nightingale. The soldier's
courage oozed away in presence of this silent peril, though he was
a man who gathered nerve before the mouths of cannon belching
grape-shot. And yet, ere long, a bold thought entered his mind, and
checked the cold sweat which was rolling from his brow. Roused to
action, as some men are when, driven face to face with death, they
defy it and offer themselves to their doom, he saw a tragedy before
him, and he resolved to play his part with honor to the last.</p>
<p>"Yesterday," he said, "the Arabs might have killed me."</p>
<p>Regarding himself as dead, he waited bravely, but with anxious
curiosity, for the waking of his enemy. When the sun rose, the
panther suddenly opened her eyes; then she stretched her paws
violently, as if to unlimber them from the cramp of their position.
Presently she yawned and showed the frightful armament of her
teeth, and her cloven tongue, rough as a grater.</p>
<p>"She is like a dainty woman," thought the Frenchman, watching
her as she rolled and turned on her side with an easy and
coquettish movement. She licked the blood from her paws, and rubbed
her head with a reiterated movement full of grace.</p>
<p>"Well done! dress yourself prettily, my little woman," said the
Frenchman, who recovered his gayety as soon as he had recovered his
courage. "We are going to bid each other good-morning;" and he felt
for the short poniard which he had taken from the Maugrabins.</p>
<p>At this instant the panther turned her head towards the
Frenchman and looked at him fixedly, without moving. The rigidity
of her metallic eyes and their insupportable clearness made the
Proven&ccedil;al shudder. The beast moved towards him; he looked at
her caressingly, with a soothing glance by which he hoped to
magnetize her. He let her come quite close to him before he
stirred; then with a touch as gentle and loving as he might have
used to a pretty woman, he slid his hand along her spine from the
head to the flanks, scratching with his nails the flexible
vertebrae which divide the yellow back of a panther. The creature
drew up her tail voluptuously, her eyes softened, and when for the
third time the Frenchman bestowed this self-interested caress, she
gave vent to a purr like that with which a cat expresses pleasure:
but it issued from a throat so deep and powerful that the sound
echoed through the grotto like the last chords of an organ rolling
along the roof of a church. The Proven&ccedil;al, perceiving the
value of his caresses, redoubled them until they had completely
soothed and lulled the imperious courtesan.</p>
<p>When he felt that he had subdued the ferocity of his capricious
companion, whose hunger had so fortunately been appeased the night
before, he rose to leave the grotto. The panther let him go; but as
soon as he reached the top of the little hill she bounded after him
with the lightness of a bird hopping from branch to branch, and
rubbed against his legs, arching her back with the gesture of a
domestic cat. Then looking at her guest with an eye that was
growing less inflexible, she uttered the savage cry which
naturalists liken to the noise of a saw.</p>
<p>"My lady is exacting," cried the Frenchman, smiling. He began to
play with her ears and stroke her belly, and at last he scratched
her head firmly with his nails. Encouraged by success, he tickled
her skull with the point of his dagger, looking for the right spot
where to stab her; but the hardness of the bone made him pause,
dreading failure.</p>
<p>The sultana of the desert acknowledged the talents of her slave
by lifting her head and swaying her neck to his caresses, betraying
satisfaction by the tranquillity of her relaxed attitude. The
Frenchman suddenly perceived that he could assassinate the fierce
princess at a blow, if he struck her in the throat; and he had
raised the weapon, when the panther, surfeited perhaps with his
caresses, threw herself gracefully at his feet, glancing up at him
with a look in which, despite her natural ferocity, a flicker of
kindness could be seen. The poor Proven&ccedil;al, frustrated for
the moment, ate his dates as he leaned against a palm-tree, casting
from time to time an interrogating eye across the desert in the
hope of discerning rescue from afar, and then lowering it upon his
terrible companion, to watch the chances of her uncertain clemency.
Each time that he threw away a date-stone the panther eyed the spot
where it fell with an expression of keen distrust; and she examined
the Frenchman with what might be called commercial prudence. The
examination, however, seemed favorable, for when the man had
finished his meagre meal she licked his shoes and wiped off the
dust, which was caked into the folds of the leather, with her rough
and powerful tongue.</p>
<p>"How will it be when she is hungry?" thought the
Proven&ccedil;al. In spite of the shudder which this reflection
cost him, his attention was attracted by the symmetrical
proportions of the animal, and he began to measure them with his
eye. She was three feet in height to the shoulder, and four feet
long, not including the tail. That powerful weapon, which was round
as a club, measured three feet. The head, as large as that of a
lioness, was remarkable for an expression of crafty intelligence;
the cold cruelty of a tiger was its ruling trait, and yet it bore a
vague resemblance to the face of an artful woman. As the soldier
watched her, the countenance of this solitary queen shone with
savage gayety like that of Nero in his cups: she had slaked her
thirst for blood, and now wished for play. The Frenchman tried to
come and go, and accustomed her to his movements. The panther left
him free, as if contented to follow him with her eyes, seeming,
however, less like a faithful dog watching his master's movements
with affection, than a huge Angora cat uneasy and suspicious of
them. A few steps brought him to the spring, where he saw the
carcass of his horse, which the panther had evidently carried
there. Only two-thirds was eaten. The sight reassured the
Frenchman; for it explained the absence of his terrible companion
and the forbearance which she had shown to him while asleep.</p>
<p>This first good luck encouraged the reckless soldier as he
thought of the future. The wild idea of making a home with the
panther until some chance of escape occurred entered his mind, and
he resolved to try every means of taming her and of turning her
good-will to account. With these thoughts he returned to her side,
and noticed joyfully that she moved her tail with an almost
imperceptible motion. He sat down beside her fearlessly, and they
began to play with each other. He held her paws and her muzzle,
twisted her ears, threw her over on her back, and stroked her soft
warm flanks. She allowed him to do so; and when he began to smooth
the fur of her paws, she carefully drew in her murderous claws,
which were sharp and curved like a Damascus blade. The Frenchman
kept one hand on his dagger, again watching his opportunity to
plunge it into the belly of the too-confiding beast; but the fear
that she might strangle him in her last convulsions once more
stayed his hand. Moreover, he felt in his heart a foreboding of a
remorse which warned him not to destroy a hitherto inoffensive
creature. He even fancied that he had found a friend in the
limitless desert. His mind turned back, involuntarily, to his first
mistress, whom he had named in derision "Mignonne," because her
jealousy was so furious that throughout the whole period of their
intercourse he lived in dread of the knife with which she
threatened him. This recollection of his youth suggested the idea
of teaching the young panther, whose soft agility and grace he now
admired with less terror, to answer to the caressing name. Towards
evening he had grown so familiar with his perilous position that he
was half in love with its dangers, and his companion was so far
tamed that she had caught the habit of turning to him when he
called, in falsetto tones, "Mignonne!"</p>
<p>As the sun went down Mignonne uttered at intervals a prolonged,
deep, melancholy cry.</p>
<p>"She is well brought up," thought the gay soldier. "She says her
prayers." But the jest only came into his mind as he watched the
peaceful attitude of his comrade.</p>
<p>"Come, my pretty blonde, I will let you go to bed first," he
said, relying on the activity of his legs to get away as soon as
she fell asleep, and trusting to find some other resting-place for
the night. He waited anxiously for the right moment, and when it
came he started vigorously in the direction of the Nile. But he had
scarcely marched for half an hour through the sand before he heard
the panther bounding after him, giving at intervals the saw-like
cry which was more terrible to hear than the thud of her
bounds.</p>
<p>"Well, well!" he cried, "she must have fallen in love with me!
Perhaps she has never met any one else. It is flattering to be her
first love."</p>
<p>So thinking, he fell into one of the treacherous quicksands
which deceive the inexperienced traveler in the desert, and from
which there is seldom any escape. He felt he was sinking, and he
uttered a cry of despair. The panther seized him by the collar with
her teeth, and sprang vigorously backward, drawing him, like magic,
from the sucking sand.</p>
<p>"Ah, Mignonne!" cried the soldier, kissing her with enthusiasm,
"we belong to each other now,--for life, for death! But play me no
tricks," he added, as he turned back the way he came.</p>
<p>From that moment the desert was, as it were, peopled for him. It
held a being to whom he could talk, and whose ferocity was now
lulled into gentleness, although he could scarcely explain to
himself the reasons for this extraordinary friendship. His anxiety
to keep awake and on his guard succumbed to excessive weariness
both of body and mind, and throwing himself down on the floor of
the grotto he slept soundly. At his waking Mignonne was gone. He
mounted the little hill to scan the horizon, and perceived her in
the far distance returning with the long bounds peculiar to these
animals, who are prevented from running by the extreme flexibility
of their spinal column.</p>
<p>Mignonne came home with bloody jaws, and received the tribute of
caresses which her slave hastened to pay, all the while manifesting
her pleasure by reiterated purring.</p>
<p>Her eyes, now soft and gentle, rested kindly on the
Proven&ccedil;al, who spoke to her lovingly as he would to a
domestic animal.</p>
<p>"Ah! Mademoiselle,--for you are an honest girl, are you not? You
like to be petted, don't you? Are you not ashamed of yourself? You
have been eating a Maugrabin. Well, well! they are animals like the
rest of you. But you are not to craunch up a Frenchman; remember
that! If you do, I will not love you."</p>
<p>She played like a young dog with her master, and let him roll
her over and pat and stroke her, and sometimes she would coax him
to play by laying a paw upon his knee with a pretty soliciting
gesture.</p>
<p>Several days passed rapidly. This strange companionship revealed
to the Proven&ccedil;al the sublime beauties of the desert. The
alternations of hope and fear, the sufficiency of food, the
presence of a creature who occupied his thoughts,--all this kept
his mind alert, yet free: it was a life full of strange contrasts.
Solitude revealed to him her secrets, and wrapped him with her
charm. In the rising and the setting of the sun he saw splendors
unknown to the world of men. He quivered as he listened to the soft
whirring of the wings of a bird,--rare visitant!--or watched the
blending of the fleeting clouds,--those changeful and many-tinted
voyagers. In the waking hours of the night he studied the play of
the moon upon the sandy ocean, where the strong simoom had rippled
the surface into waves and ever-varying undulations. He lived in
the Eastern day; he worshiped its marvelous glory. He rejoiced in
the grandeur of the storms when they rolled across the vast plain,
and tossed the sand upward till it looked like a dry red fog or a
solid death-dealing vapor; and as the night came on he welcomed it
with ecstasy, grateful for the blessed coolness of the light of the
stars. His ears listened to the music of the skies. Solitude taught
him the treasures of meditation. He spent hours in recalling
trifles, and in comparing his past life with the weird present.</p>
<p>He grew fondly attached to his panther; for he was a man who
needed an affection. Whether it were that his own will,
magnetically strong, had modified the nature of his savage
princess, or that the wars then raging in the desert had provided
her with an ample supply of food, it is certain that she showed no
sign of attacking him, and became so tame that he soon felt no fear
of her. He spent much of his time in sleeping; though with his mind
awake, like a spider in its web, lest he should miss some
deliverance that might chance to cross the sandy sphere marked out
by the horizon. He had made his shirt into a banner and tied it to
the top of a palm-tree which he had stripped of its leafage. Taking
counsel of necessity, he kept the flag extended by fastening the
corners with twigs and wedges; for the fitful wind might have
failed to wave it at the moment when the longed-for succor came in
sight.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there were long hours of gloom when hope forsook
him; and then he played with his panther. He learned to know the
different inflections of her voice and the meanings of her
expressive glance; he studied the variegation of the spots which
shaded the dead gold of her robe. Mignonne no longer growled when
he caught the tuft of her dangerous tail and counted the black and
white rings which glittered in the sunlight like a cluster of
precious stones. He delighted in the soft lines of her lithe body,
the whiteness of her belly, the grace of her charming head: but
above all he loved to watch her as she gamboled at play. The
agility and youthfulness of her movements were a constantly fresh
surprise to him. He admired the suppleness of the flexible body as
she bounded, crept, and glided, or clung to the trunk of
palm-trees, or rolled over and over, crouching sometimes to the
ground, and gathering herself together as she made ready for her
vigorous spring. Yet, however vigorous the bound, however slippery
the granite block on which she landed, she would stop short,
motionless, at the one word "Mignonne."</p>
<p>One day, under a dazzling sun, a large bird hovered in the sky.
The Proven&ccedil;al left his panther to watch the new guest. After
a moment's pause the neglected sultana uttered a low growl.</p>
<p>"The devil take me! I believe she is jealous!" exclaimed the
soldier, observing the rigid look which once more appeared in her
metallic eyes. "The soul of Sophronie has got into her body!"</p>
<p>The eagle disappeared in ether, and the Frenchman, recalled by
the panther's displeasure, admired afresh her rounded flanks and
the perfect grace of her attitude. She was as pretty as a woman.
The blonde brightness of her robe shaded, with delicate gradations,
to the dead-white tones of her furry thighs; the vivid sunshine
brought out the brilliancy of this living gold and its variegated
brown spots with indescribable lustre. The panther and the
Proven&ccedil;al gazed at each other with human comprehension. She
trembled with delight--the coquettish creature!--as she felt the
nails of her friend scratching the strong bones of her skull. Her
eyes glittered like flashes of lightning, and then she closed them
tightly.</p>
<p>"She has a soul!" cried the soldier, watching the tranquil
repose of this sovereign of the desert, golden as the sands, white
as their pulsing light, solitary and burning as they.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>"Well," she said, "I have read your defense of the beasts. But
tell me what was the end of this friendship between two beings so
formed to understand each other?"</p>
<p>"Ah, exactly," I replied. "It ended as all great passions
end,--by a misunderstanding. Both sides imagine treachery, pride
prevents an explanation, and the rupture comes about through
obstinacy."</p>
<p>"Yes," she said, "and sometimes a word, a look, an exclamation
suffices. But tell me the end of the story."</p>
<p>"That is difficult," I answered. "But I will give it to you in
the words of the old veteran, as he finished the bottle of
champagne and exclaimed:--</p>
<p>"'I don't know how I could have hurt her, but she suddenly
turned upon me as if in fury, and seized my thigh with her sharp
teeth; and yet (as I afterwards remembered) not cruelly. I thought
she meant to devour me, and I plunged my dagger into her throat.
She rolled over with a cry that froze my soul; she looked at me in
her death struggle, but without anger. I would have given all the
world--my cross, which I had not then gained, all, everything--to
have brought her back to life. It was as if I had murdered a
friend, a human being. When the soldiers who saw my flag came to my
rescue they found me weeping. Monsieur,' he resumed, after a
moment's silence, 'I went through the wars in Germany, Spain,
Russia, France; I have marched my carcass well-nigh over all the
world; but I have seen nothing comparable to the desert. Ah, it is
grand! glorious!'</p>
<p>"'What were your feelings there?' I asked.</p>
<p>"'They cannot be told, young man. Besides, I do not always
regret my panther and my palm-tree oasis: I must be very sad for
that. But I will tell you this: in the desert there is all--and yet
nothing.'</p>
<p>"'Stay!--explain that.'</p>
<p>"'Well, then,' he said, with a gesture of impatience, 'God is
there, and man is not.'"</p>

<h3>FROM 'THE COUNTRY DOCTOR'</h3>
<h4>THE NAPOLEON OF THE PEOPLE</h4>
<p>"Let us go to my barn," said the doctor, taking Genestas by the
arm, after saying good-night to the curate and his other guests.
"And there, Captain Bluteau, you will hear about Napoleon. We shall
find a few old cronies who will set Goguelat, the postman, to
declaiming about the people's god. Nicolle, my stable-man, was to
put a ladder by which we can get into the hay-loft through a
window, and find a place where we can see and hear all that goes
on. A <i>veill&eacute;e</i> is worth the trouble, believe me. Come,
it isn't the first time I've hidden in the hay to hear the tale of
a soldier or some peasant yarn. But we must hide; if these poor
people see a stranger they are constrained at once, and are no
longer their natural selves."</p>
<p>"Eh! my dear host," said Genestas, "haven't I often pretended to
sleep, that I might listen to my troopers round a bivouac? I never
laughed more heartily in the Paris theatres than I did at an
account of the retreat from Moscow, told in fun, by an old sergeant
to a lot of recruits who were afraid of war. He declared the French
army slept in sheets, and drank its wine well-iced; that the dead
stood still in the roads; Russia was white, they curried the horses
with their teeth; those who liked to skate had lots of fun, and
those who fancied frozen puddings ate their fill; the women were
usually cold, and the only thing that was really disagreeable was
the want of hot water to shave with: in short, he recounted such
absurdities that an old quarter-master, who had had his nose frozen
off and was known by the name Nez-restant, laughed himself."</p>
<p>"Hush," said Benassis, "here we are: I'll go first; follow
me."</p>
<p>The pair mounted the ladder and crouched in the hay, without
being seen or heard by the people below, and placed themselves at
ease, so that they could see and hear all that went on. The women
were sitting in groups round the three or four candles that stood
on the tables. Some were sewing, some knitting; several sat idle,
their necks stretched out and their heads and eyes turned to an old
peasant who was telling a story. Most of the men were standing, or
lying on bales of hay. These groups, all perfectly silent, were
scarcely visible in the flickering glimmer of the tallow-candles
encircled by glass bowls full of water, which concentrated the
light in rays upon the women at work about the tables. The size of
the barn, whose roof was dark and sombre, still further obscured
the rays of light, which touched the heads with unequal color, and
brought out picturesque effects of light and shade. Here, the brown
forehead and the clear eyes of an eager little peasant-girl shone
forth; there, the rough brows of a few old men were sharply defined
by a luminous band, which made fantastic shapes of their worn and
discolored garments. These various listeners, so diverse in their
attitudes, all expressed on their motionless features the absolute
abandonment of their intelligence to the narrator. It was a curious
picture, illustrating the enormous influence exercised over every
class of mind by poetry. In exacting from a story-teller the
marvelous that must still be simple, or the impossible that is
almost believable, the peasant proves himself to be a true lover of
the purest poetry.</p>
<p>"Come, Monsieur Goguelat," said the game-keeper, "tell us about
the Emperor."</p>
<p>"The evening is half over," said the postman, "and I don't like
to shorten the victories."</p>
<p>"Never mind; go on! You've told them so many times we know them
all by heart; but it is always a pleasure to hear them again."</p>
<p>"Yes! tell us about the Emperor," cried many voices
together.</p>
<p>"Since you wish it," replied Goguelat. "But you'll see it isn't
worth much when I have to tell it on the double-quick, charge! I'd
rather tell about a battle. Shall I tell about Champ-Aubert, where
we used up all the cartridges and spitted the enemy on our
bayonets?"</p>
<p>"No! no! the Emperor! the Emperor!"</p>
<p>The veteran rose from his bale of hay and cast upon the
assemblage that black look laden with miseries, emergencies, and
sufferings, which distinguishes the faces of old soldiers. He
seized his jacket by the two front flaps, raised them as if about
to pack the knapsack which formerly held his clothes, his shoes,
and all his fortune; then he threw the weight of his body on his
left leg, advanced the right, and yielded with a good grace to the
demands of the company. After pushing his gray hair to one side to
show his forehead, he raised his head towards heaven that he might,
as it were, put himself on the level of the gigantic history he was
about to relate.</p>
<p>"You see, my friends, Napoleon was born in Corsica, a French
island, warmed by the sun of Italy, where it is like a furnace, and
where the people kill each other, from father to son, all about
nothing: that's a way they have. To begin with the marvel of the
thing,--his mother, who was the handsomest woman of her time, and a
knowing one, bethought herself of dedicating him to God, so that he
might escape the dangers of his childhood and future life; for she
had dreamed that the world was set on fire the day he was born. And
indeed it was a prophecy! So she asked God to protect him, on
condition that Napoleon should restore His holy religion, which was
then cast to the ground. Well, that was agreed upon, and we shall
see what came of it.</p>
<p>"Follow me closely, and tell me if what you hear is in the
nature of man.</p>
<p>"Sure and certain it is that none but a man who conceived the
idea of making a compact with God could have passed unhurt through
the enemy's lines, through cannon-balls, and discharges of
grape-shot that swept the rest of us off like flies, and always
respected his head. I had a proof of that--I myself--at Eylau. I
see him now, as he rode up a height, took his field glass, looked
at the battle, and said, 'A11 goes well.' One of those plumed
busy-bodies, who plagued him considerably and followed him
everywhere, even to his meals, so they said, thought to play the
wag, and took the Emperor's place as he rode away. Ho! in a
twinkling, head and plume were off! You must understand that
Napoleon had promised to keep the secret of his compact all to
himself. That's why all those who followed him, even his nearest
friends, fell like nuts,--Duroc, Bessi&egrave;res, Lannes,--all
strong as steel bars, though <i>he</i> could bend them as he
pleased. Besides,--to prove he was the child of God, and made to be
the father of soldiers,--was he ever known to be lieutenant or
captain? no, no; commander-in-chief from the start. He didn't look
to be more than twenty-four years of age when he was an old general
at the taking of Toulon, where he first began to show the others
that they knew nothing about manoeuvring cannon.</p>
<p>"After that, down came our slip of a general to command the
grand army of Italy, which hadn't bread nor munitions, nor shoes,
nor coats,--a poor army, as naked as a worm. 'My friends,' said he,
'here we are together. Get it into your pates that fifteen days
from now you will be conquerors,--new clothes, good gaiters, famous
shoes, and every man with a great-coat; but, my children, to get
these things you must march to Milan where they are.' And we
marched. France, crushed as flat as a bedbug, straightened up. We
were thirty thousand barefeet against eighty thousand Austrian
bullies, all fine men, well set up. I see 'em now! But Napoleon--he
was then only Bonaparte--he knew how to put the courage into us! We
marched by night, and we marched by day; we slapped their faces at
Montenotte, we thrashed 'em at Rivoli, Lodi, Arcole, Millesimo, and
we never let 'em up. A soldier gets the taste of conquest. So
Napoleon whirled round those Austrian generals, who didn't know
where to poke themselves to get out of his way, and he pelted 'em
well,--nipped off ten thousand men at a blow sometimes, by getting
round them with fifteen hundred Frenchmen, and then he gleaned as
he pleased. He took their cannon, their supplies, their money,
their munitions, in short, all they had that was good to take. He
fought them and beat them on the mountains, he drove them into the
rivers and seas, he bit 'em in the air, he devoured 'em on the
ground, and he lashed 'em everywhere. Hey! the grand army feathered
itself well; for, d'ye see, the Emperor, who was also a wit, called
up the inhabitants and told them he was there to deliver them. So
after that the natives lodged and cherished us; the women too, and
very judicious they were. Now here's the end of it. In Ventose,
'96,--in those times that was the month of March of to-day,--we lay
cuddled in a corner of Savoy with the marmots; and yet, before that
campaign was over, we were masters of Italy, just as Napoleon had
predicted; and by the following March--in a single year and two
campaigns--he had brought us within sight of Vienna. 'Twas a clean
sweep. We devoured their armies, one after the other, and made an
end of four Austrian generals. One old fellow, with white hair, was
roasted like a rat in the straw at Mantua. Kings begged for mercy
on their knees! Peace was won.</p>
<p>"Could a <i>man</i> have done that? No; God helped him, to a
certainty!</p>
<p>"He divided himself up like the loaves in the Gospel, commanded
the battle by day, planned it by night; going and coming, for the
sentinels saw him,--never eating, never sleeping. So, seeing these
prodigies, the soldiers adopted him for their father. Forward,
march! Then those others, the rulers in Paris, seeing this, said to
themselves:--'Here's a bold one that seems to get his orders from
the skies; he's likely to put his paw on France. We must let him
loose on Asia; we will send him to America, perhaps that will
satisfy him.' But 'twas <i>written above</i> for him, as it was for
Jesus Christ. The command went forth that he should go to Egypt.
See again his resemblance to the Son of God. But that's not all. He
called together his best veterans, his fire-eaters, the ones he had
particularly put the devil into, and he said to them like
this:--'My friends, they have given us Egypt to chew up, just to
keep us busy, but we'll swallow it whole in a couple of campaigns,
as we did Italy. The common soldiers shall be princes and have the
land for their own. Forward, march!' 'Forward, march!' cried the
sergeants, and there we were at Toulon, road to Egypt. At that time
the English had all their ships in the sea; but when we embarked
Napoleon said, 'They won't see us. It is just as well that you
should know from this time forth that your general has got his star
in the sky, which guides and protects us.' What was said was done.
Passing over the sea, we took Malta like an orange, just to quench
his thirst for victory; for he was a man who couldn't live and do
nothing.</p>
<p>"So here we are in Egypt. Good. Once here, other orders. The
Egyptians, d'ye see, are men who, ever since the earth was, have
had giants for sovereigns, and armies as numerous as ants; for, you
must understand, that's the land of genii and crocodiles, where
they've built pyramids as big as our mountains, and buried their
kings under them to keep them fresh,--an idea that pleased 'em
mightily. So then, after we disembarked, the Little Corporal said
to us, 'My children, the country you are going to conquer has a lot
of gods that you must respect; because Frenchmen ought to be
friends with everybody, and fight the nations without vexing the
inhabitants. Get it into your skulls that you are not to touch
anything at first, for it is all going to be yours soon. Forward,
march!' So far, so good. But all those people of Africa, to whom
Napoleon was foretold under the name of K&eacute;bir-Bonaberdis,--a
word of their lingo that means 'the sultan fires,'--were afraid as
the devil of him. So the Grand Turk, and Asia, and Africa, had
recourse to magic. They sent us a demon, named the Mahdi, supposed
to have descended from heaven on a white horse, which, like its
master, was bullet-proof; and both of them lived on air, without
food to support them. There are some that say they saw them; but I
can't give you any reasons to make you certain about that. The
rulers of Arabia and the Mamelukes tried to make their troopers
believe that the Mahdi could keep them from perishing in battle;
and they pretended he was an angel sent from heaven to fight
Napoleon and get back Solomon's seal. Solomon's seal was part of
their paraphernalia which they vowed our General had stolen. You
must understand that we'd given 'em a good many wry faces, in spite
of what he had said to us.</p>
<p>"Now, tell me how they knew that Napoleon had a pact with God?
Was that natural, d'ye think?</p>
<p>"They held to it in their minds that Napoleon commanded the
genii, and could pass hither and thither in the twinkling of an
eye, like a bird. The fact is, he was everywhere. At last, it came
to his carrying off a queen, beautiful as the dawn, for whom he had
offered all his treasure, and diamonds as big as pigeons' eggs,--a
bargain which the Mameluke to whom she particularly belonged
positively refused, although he had several others. Such matters,
when they come to that pass, can't be settled without a great many
battles; and, indeed, there was no scarcity of battles; there was
fighting enough to please everybody. We were in line at Alexandria,
at Gizeh, and before the Pyramids; we marched in the sun and
through the sand, where some, who had the dazzles, saw water that
they couldn't drink, and shade where their flesh was roasted. But
we made short work of the Mamelukes; and everybody else yielded at
the voice of Napoleon, who took possession of Upper and Lower
Egypt, Arabia, and even the capitals of kingdoms that were no more,
where there were thousand of statues and all the plagues of Egypt,
more particularly lizards,--a mammoth of a country where everybody
could take his acres of land for as little as he pleased. Well,
while Napoleon was busy with his affairs inland,--where he had it
in his head to do fine things,--the English burned his fleet at
Aboukir; for they were always looking about them to annoy us. But
Napoleon, who had the respect of the East and of the West, whom the
Pope called his son, and the cousin of Mohammed called 'his dear
father,' resolved to punish England, and get hold of India in
exchange for his fleet. He was just about to take us across the Red
Sea into Asia, a country where there are diamonds and gold to pay
the soldiers and palaces for bivouacs, when the Mahdi made a treaty
with the Plague, and sent it down to hinder our victories. Halt!
The army to a man defiled at that parade; and few there were who
came back on their feet. Dying soldiers couldn't take Saint-Jean
d'Acre, though they rushed at it three times with generous and
martial obstinacy. The Plague was the strongest. No saying to that
enemy, 'My good friend.' Every soldier lay ill. Napoleon alone was
fresh as a rose, and the whole army saw him drinking in pestilence
without its doing him a bit of harm.</p>
<p>"Ha! my friends! will you tell me that <i>that's</i> in the
nature of a mere man?</p>
<p>"The Mamelukes knowing we were all in the ambulances, thought
they could stop the way; but that sort of joke wouldn't do with
Napoleon. So he said to his demons, his veterans, those that had
the toughest hide, 'Go, clear me the way.' Junot, a sabre of the
first cut, and his particular friend, took a thousand men, no more,
and ripped up the army of the pacha who had had the presumption to
put himself in the way. After that, we came back to headquarters at
Cairo. Now, here's another side of the story. Napoleon absent,
France was letting herself be ruined by the rulers in Paris, who
kept back the pay of the soldiers of the other armies, and their
clothing, and their rations; left them to die of hunger, and
expected them to lay down the law to the universe without taking
any trouble to help them. Idiots! who amused themselves by
chattering, instead of putting their own hands in the dough. Well,
that's how it happened that our armies were beaten, and the
frontiers of France were encroached upon: THE MAN was not there.
Now observe, I say <i>man</i> because that's what they called him;
but 'twas nonsense, for he had a star and all its belongings; it
was we who were only men. He taught history to France after his
famous battle of Aboukir, where, without losing more than three
hundred men, and with a single division, he vanquished the grand
army of the Turk, seventy-five thousand strong, and hustled more
than half of it into the sea, r-r-rah!</p>
<p>"That was his last thunder-clap in Egypt. He said to himself,
seeing the way things were going in Paris, 'I am the savior of
France. I know it, and I must go.' But, understand me, the army
didn't know he was going, or they'd have kept him by force and made
him Emperor of the East. So now we were sad; for He was gone who
was all our joy. He left the command to Kl&eacute;ber, a big
mastiff, who came off duty at Cairo, assassinated by an Egyptian,
whom they put to death by impaling him on a bayonet; that's the way
they guillotine people down there. But it makes 'em suffer so much
that a soldier had pity on the criminal and gave him his canteen;
and then, as soon as the Egyptian had drunk his fill, he gave up
the ghost with all the pleasure in life. But that's a trifle we
couldn't laugh at then. Napoleon embarked in a cockleshell, a
little skiff that was nothing at all, though 'twas called
'Fortune'; and in a twinkling, under the nose of England, who was
blockading him with ships of the line, frigates, and anything that
could hoist a sail, he crossed over, and there he was in France.
For he always had the power, mind you, of crossing the seas at one
straddle.</p>
<p>"Was that a human man? Bah!</p>
<p>"So, one minute he is at Fr&eacute;jus, the next in Paris.
There, they all adore him; but he summons the government. 'What
have you done with my children, the soldiers?' he says to the
lawyers. 'You're a mob of rascally scribblers; you are making
France a mess of pottage, and snapping your fingers at what people
think of you. It won't do; and I speak the opinion of everybody.'
So, on that, they wanted to battle with him and kill him--click! he
had 'em locked up in barracks, or flying out of windows, or drafted
among his followers, where they were as mute as fishes, and as
pliable as a quid of tobacco. After that stroke--consul! And then,
as it was not for him to doubt the Supreme Being, he fulfilled his
promise to the good God, who, you see, had kept His word to him. He
gave Him back his churches, and re-established His religion; the
bells rang for God and for him: and lo! everybody was pleased:
<i>primo</i>, the priests, whom he saved from being harassed;
<i>secundo</i>, the bourgeois, who thought only of their trade, and
no longer had to fear the <i>rapiamus</i> of the law, which had got
to be unjust; <i>tertio</i>, the nobles, for he forbade they should
be killed, as, unfortunately, the people had got the habit of
doing.</p>
<p>"But he still had the Enemy to wipe out; and he wasn't the man
to go to sleep at a mess-table, because, d'ye see, his eye looked
over the whole earth as if it were no bigger than a man's head. So
then he appeared in Italy, like as though he had stuck his head
through the window. One glance was enough. The Austrians were
swallowed up at Marengo like so many gudgeons by a whale! Ouf! The
French eagles sang their paeans so loud that all the world heard
them--and it sufficed! 'We won't play that game any more,' said the
German. 'Enough, enough!' said all the rest.</p>
<p>"To sum up: Europe backed down, England knocked under. General
peace; and the kings and the people made believe kiss each other.
That's the time when the Emperor invented the Legion of Honor--and
a fine thing, too. 'In France'--this is what he said at Boulogne
before the whole army--'every man is brave. So the citizen who does
a fine action shall be sister to the soldier, and the soldier shall
be his brother, and the two shall be one under the flag of
honor.'</p>
<p>"We, who were down in Egypt, now came home. All was changed! He
left us general, and hey! in a twinkling we found him EMPEROR.
France gave herself to him, like a fine girl to a lancer. When it
was done--to the satisfaction of all, as you may say--a sacred
ceremony took place, the like of which was never seen under the
canopy of the skies. The Pope and the cardinals, in their red and
gold vestments, crossed the Alps expressly to crown him before the
army and the people, who clapped their hands. There is one thing
that I should do very wrong not to tell you. In Egypt, in the
desert close to Syria, the RED MAN came to him on the Mount of
Moses, and said, 'All is well.' Then, at Marengo, the night before
the victory, the same Red Man appeared before him for the second
time, standing erect and saying, 'Thou shalt see the world at thy
feet; thou shalt be Emperor of France, King of Italy, master of
Holland, sovereign of Spain, Portugal, and the Illyrian provinces,
protector of Germany, savior of Poland, first eagle of the Legion
of Honor--all.' This Red Man, you understand, was his genius, his
spirit,--a sort of satellite who served him, as some say, to
communicate with his star. I never really believed that. But the
Red Man himself is a true fact. Napoleon spoke of him, and said he
came to him in troubled moments, and lived in the palace of the
Tuileries under the roof. So, on the day of the coronation,
Napoleon saw him for the third time; and they were in consultation
over many things.</p>
<p>"After that, Napoleon went to Milan to be crowned king of Italy,
and there the grand triumph of the soldier began. Every man who
could write was made an officer. Down came pensions; it rained
duchies; treasures poured in for the staff which didn't cost France
a penny; and the Legion of Honor provided incomes for the private
soldiers,--of which I receive mine to this day. So here were the
armies maintained as never before on this earth. But besides that,
the Emperor, knowing that he was to be the emperor of the whole
world, bethought him of the bourgeois, and to please them he built
fairy monuments, after their own ideas, in places where you'd never
think to find any. For instance, suppose you were coming back from
Spain and going to Berlin--well, you'd find triumphal arches along
the way, with common soldiers sculptured on the stone, every bit
the same as generals. In two or three years, and without imposing
taxes on any of you, Napoleon filled his vaults with gold, built
palaces, made bridges, roads, scholars, f&ecirc;tes, laws, vessels,
harbors, and spent millions upon millions,--such enormous sums that
he could, so they tell me, have paved France from end to end with
five-franc pieces, if he had had a mind to.</p>
<p>"Now, when he sat at ease on his throne, and was master of all,
so that Europe waited his permission to do his bidding, he
remembered his four brothers and his three sisters, and he said to
us, as it might be in conversation, in an order of the day, 'My
children, is it right that the blood relations of your Emperor
should be begging their bread? No. I wish to see them in splendor
like myself. It becomes, therefore, absolutely necessary to conquer
a kingdom for each of them,--to the end that Frenchmen may be
masters over all lands, that the soldiers of the Guard shall make
the whole earth tremble, that France may spit where she likes, and
that all the nations shall say to her, as it is written on my
copper coins, '<i>God protects you</i>!' 'Agreed,' cried the army.
'We'll go fish for thy kingdoms with our bayonets.' Ha! there was
no backing down, don't you see! If he had taken it into his head to
conquer the moon, we should have made ready, packed knapsacks, and
clambered up; happily, he didn't think of it. The kings of the
countries, who liked their comfortable thrones, were naturally
loathe to budge, and had to have their ears pulled; so
then--Forward, march! We did march; we got there; and the earth
once more trembled to its centre. Hey! the men and the shoes he
used up in those days! The enemy dealt us such blows that none but
the grand army could have stood the fatigue of it. But you are not
ignorant that a Frenchman is born a philosopher, and knows that a
little sooner, or a little later, he has got to die. So we were
ready to die without a word, for we liked to see the Emperor doing
<i>that</i> on the geographies."</p>
<p>Here the narrator nimbly described a circle with his foot on the
floor of the barn.</p>
<p>"And Napoleon said, 'There, that's to be a kingdom.' And a
kingdom it was. Ha! the good times! The colonels were generals; the
generals, marshals; and the marshals, kings. There's one of 'em
still on his throne, to prove it to Europe; but he's a Gascon and a
traitor to France for keeping that crown; and he doesn't blush for
shame as he ought to do, because crowns, don't you see, are made of
gold. I who am speaking to you, I have seen, in Paris, eleven kings
and a mob of princes surrounding Napoleon like the rays of the sun.
You understand, of course, that every soldier had the chance to
mount a throne, provided always he had the merit; so a corporal of
the Guard was a sight to be looked at as he walked along, for each
man had his share in the victory, and 'twas plainly set forth in
the bulletin. What victories they were! Austerlitz, where the army
manoeuvred as if on parade; Eylau, where we drowned the Russians in
a lake, as though Napoleon had blown them into it with the breath
of his mouth; Wagram, where the army fought for three days without
grumbling. We won as many battles as there are saints in the
calendar. It was proved then beyond a doubt, that Napoleon had the
sword of God in his scabbard. The soldiers were his friends; he
made them his children; he looked after us; he saw that we had
shoes, and shirts, and great-coats, and bread, and cartridges; but
he always kept up his majesty; for, don't you see, 'twas his
business to reign. No matter for that, however; a sergeant, and
even a common soldier could say to him, 'My Emperor,' just as you
say to me sometimes, 'My good friend.' He gave us an answer if we
appealed to him; he slept in the snow like the rest of us; and
indeed, he had almost the air of a human man. I who speak to you, I
have seen him with his feet among the grapeshot, and no more uneasy
than you are now,--standing steady, looking through his field
glass, and minding his business. 'Twas that kept the rest of us
quiet. I don't know how he did it, but when he spoke he made our
hearts burn within us; and to show him we were his children,
incapable of balking, didn't we rush at the mouths of the rascally
cannon, that belched and vomited shot and shell without so much as
saying, 'Look out!' Why! the dying must needs raise their heads to
salute him and cry, 'LONG LIVE THE EMPEROR!'</p>
<p>"I ask you, was that natural? would they have done that for a
human man?</p>
<p>"Well, after he had settled the world, the Empress Josephine,
his wife, a good woman all the same, managed matters so that she
did not bear him any children, and he was obliged to give her up,
though he loved her considerably. But, you see, he had to have
little ones for reasons of state. Hearing of this, all the
sovereigns of Europe quarreled as to which of them should give him
a wife. And he married, so they told us, an Austrian archduchess,
daughter of Caesar, an ancient man about whom people talk a good
deal, and not in France only,--where any one will tell you what he
did,--but in Europe. It is all true, for I myself who address you
at this moment, I have been on the Danube, and have seen the
remains of a bridge built by that man, who, it seems, was a
relation of Napoleon in Rome, and that's how the Emperor got the
inheritance of that city for his son. So after the marriage, which
was a f&ecirc;te for the whole world, and in honor of which he
released the people of ten years' taxes,--which they had to pay all
the same, however, because the assessors didn't take account of
what he said,--his wife had a little one, who was King of Rome.
Now, there's a thing that had never been seen on this earth; never
before was a child born a king with his father living. On that day
a balloon went up in Paris to tell the news to Rome, and that
balloon made the journey in one day!</p>
<p>"Now, is there any man among you who will stand up and declare
to me that all that was human? No; it was <i>written above;</i> and
may the scurvy seize them who deny that he was sent by God himself
for the triumph of France!</p>
<p>"Well, here's the Emperor of Russia, that used to be his friend,
he gets angry because Napoleon didn't marry a Russian; so he joins
with the English, our enemies,--to whom our Emperor always wanted
to say a couple of words in their burrows, only he was prevented.
Napoleon gets angry too; an end had to be put to such doings; so he
says to us:--'Soldiers! you have been masters of every capital in
Europe, except Moscow, which is now the ally of England. To conquer
England, and India which belongs to the English, it becomes our
peremptory duty to go to Moscow.' Then he assembled the greatest
army that ever trailed its gaiters over the globe; and so
marvelously in hand it was that he reviewed a million of men in one
day. 'Hourra! cried the Russians. Down came all Russia and those
animals of Cossacks in a flock. 'Twas nation against nation, a
general hurly-burly, and beware who could; 'Asia against Europe,'
as the Red Man had foretold to Napoleon. 'Enough,' cried the
Emperor, 'I'll be ready.'</p>
<p>"So now, sure enough, came all the kings, as the Red Man had
said, to lick Napoleon's hand! Austria, Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony,
Poland, Italy, every one of them were with us, flattering us; ah,
it was fine! The eagles never cawed so loud as at those parades,
perched high above the banners of all Europe. The Poles were
bursting with joy, because Napoleon was going to release them; and
that's why France and Poland are brothers to this day. 'Russia is
ours,' cried the army. We plunged into it well supplied; we marched
and we marched,--no Russians. At last we found the brutes
entrenched on the banks of the Moskova. That's where I won my
cross, and I've got the right to say it was a damnable battle. This
was how it came about. The Emperor was anxious. He had seen the Red
Man, who said to him, 'My son, you are going too fast for your
feet; you will lack men; friends will betray you.' So the Emperor
offered peace. But before signing, 'Let us drub those Russians!' he
said to us. 'Done!' cried the army. 'Forward, march!' said the
sergeants. My clothes were in rags, my shoes worn out, from
trudging along those roads, which are very uncomfortable ones; but
no matter! I said to myself, 'As it's the last of our
earthquakings, I'll go into it, tooth and nail!' We were drawn up
in line before the great ravine,--front seats, as 'twere. Signal
given; and seven hundred pieces of artillery began a conversation
that would bring the blood from your ears. Then--must do justice to
one's enemies--the Russians let themselves be killed like
Frenchmen; they wouldn't give way; we couldn't advance. 'Forward,'
some one cried, 'here comes the Emperor!' True enough; he passed at
a gallop, waving his hand to let us know we must take the redoubt.
He inspired us; on we ran, I was the first in the ravine. Ha! my
God! how the lieutenants fell, and the colonels, and the soldiers!
No matter! all the more shoes for those that had none, and epaulets
for the clever ones who knew how to read. 'Victory!' cried the
whole line; 'Victory!'--and, would you believe it? a thing never
seen before, there lay twenty-five thousand Frenchmen on the
ground. 'Twas like mowing down a wheat-field; only in place of the
ears of wheat put the heads of men! We were sobered by this
time,--those who were left alive. The MAN rode up; we made a circle
round him. Ha! he knew how to cajole his children; he could be
amiable when he liked, and feed 'em with words when their stomachs
were ravenous with the hunger of wolves. Flatterer! he distributed
the crosses himself, he uncovered to the dead, and then he cried to
us, 'On! to Moscow!' 'To Moscow!' answered the army.</p>
<p>"We took Moscow. Would you believe it? the Russians burned their
own city! 'Twas a haystack six miles square, and it blazed for two
days. The buildings crashed like slates, and showers of melted iron
and lead rained down upon us, which was naturally horrible. I may
say to you plainly, it was like a flash of lightning on our
disasters. The Emperor said, 'We have done enough; my soldiers
shall rest here.' So we rested awhile, just to get the breath into
our bodies and the flesh on our bones, for we were really tired. We
took possession of the golden cross that was on the Kremlin; and
every soldier brought away with him a small fortune. But out there
the winter sets in a month earlier,--a thing those fools of science
didn't properly explain. So, coming back, the cold nipped us. No
longer an army--do you hear me?--no longer any generals, no longer
any sergeants even. 'Twas the reign of wretchedness and hunger,--a
reign of equality at last. No one thought of anything but to see
France once more; no one stooped to pick up his gun or his money if
he dropped them; each man followed his nose, and went as he pleased
without caring for glory. The weather was so bad the Emperor
couldn't see his star; there was something between him and the
skies. Poor man! it made him ill to see his eagles flying away from
victory. Ah! 'twas a mortal blow, you may believe me.</p>
<p>"Well, we got to the Beresina. My friends, I can affirm to you
by all that is most sacred, by my honor, that since mankind came
into the world, never, never, was there seen such a fricassee of an
army--guns, carriages, artillery wagons--in the midst of such
snows, under such relentless skies! The muzzles of the muskets
burned our hands if we touched them, the iron was so cold. It was
there that the army was saved by the pontoniers, who were firm at
their post; and there that Gondrin--sole survivor of the men who
were bold enough to go into the water and build the bridges by
which the army crossed--that Gondrin, here present, admirably
conducted himself, and saved us from the Russians, who, I must tell
you, still respected the grand army, remembering its victories.
And," he added, pointing to Gondrin, who was gazing at him with the
peculiar attention of a deaf man, "Gondrin is a finished soldier, a
soldier who is honor itself, and he merits your highest
esteem."</p>
<p>"I saw the Emperor," he resumed, "standing by the bridge,
motionless, not feeling the cold--was that human? He looked at the
destruction of his treasure, his friends, his old Egyptians. Bah!
all that passed him, women, army wagons, artillery, all were
shattered, destroyed, ruined. The bravest carried the eagles; for
the eagles, d'ye see, were France, the nation, all of you! they
were the civil and the military honor that must be kept pure; could
their heads be lowered because of the cold? It was only near the
Emperor that we warmed ourselves, because when he was in danger we
ran, frozen as we were--we, who wouldn't have stretched a hand to
save a friend. They told us he wept at night over his poor family
of soldiers. Ah! none but he and Frenchmen could have got
themselves out of that business.</p>
<p>"We did get out, but with losses, great losses, as I tell you.
The Allies captured our provisions. Men began to betray him, as the
Red Man predicted. Those chatterers in Paris, who had held their
tongues after the Imperial Guard was formed, now thought he was
dead; so they hoodwinked the prefect of police, and hatched a
conspiracy to overthrow the empire. He heard of it; it worried him.
He left us, saying: 'Adieu, my children; guard the outposts; I
shall return to you.' Bah! without him nothing went right; the
generals lost their heads; the marshals talked nonsense and
committed follies; but that was not surprising, for Napoleon, who
was kind, had fed 'em on gold; they had got as fat as lard, and
wouldn't stir; some stayed in camp when they ought to have been
warming the backs of the enemy who was between us and France.</p>
<p>"But the Emperor came back, and he brought recruits, famous
recruits; he changed their backbone and made 'em dogs of war, fit
to set their teeth into anything; and he brought a guard of honor,
a fine body indeed!--all bourgeois, who melted away like butter on
a gridiron.</p>
<p>"Well, spite of our stern bearing, here's everything going
against us; and yet the army did prodigies of valor. Then came
battles on the mountains, nations against nations,--Dresden,
Lutzen, Bautzen. Remember these days, all of you, for 'twas then
that Frenchmen were so particularly heroic that a good grenadier
only lasted six months. We triumphed always; yet there were those
English, in our rear, rousing revolts against us with their lies!
No matter, we cut our way home through the whole pack of the
nations. Wherever the Emperor showed himself we followed him; for
if, by sea or land, he gave us the word 'Go!' we went. At last, we
were in France; and many a poor foot-soldier felt the air of his
own country restore his soul to satisfaction, spite of the wintry
weather. I can say for myself that it refreshed my life. Well,
next, our business was to defend France, our country, our beautiful
France, against all Europe, which resented our having laid down the
law to the Russians, and pushed them back into their dens, so that
they couldn't eat us up alive, as northern nations, who are dainty
and like southern flesh, have a habit of doing,--at least, so I've
heard some generals say. Then the Emperor saw his own
father-in-law, his friends whom he had made kings, and the
scoundrels to whom he had given back their thrones, all against
him. Even Frenchmen, and allies in our own ranks, turned against us
under secret orders, as at the battle of Leipsic. Would common
soldiers have been capable of such wickedness? Three times a day
men were false to their word,--and they called themselves
princes!</p>
<p>"So, then, France was invaded. Wherever the Emperor showed his
lion face, the enemy retreated; and he did more prodigies in
defending France than ever he had done in conquering Italy, the
East, Spain, Europe, and Russia. He meant to bury every invader
under the sod, and teach 'em to respect the soil of France. So he
let them get to Paris, that he might swallow them at a mouthful,
and rise to the height of his genius in a battle greater than all
the rest,--a mother-battle, as 'twere. But there, there! the
Parisians were afraid for their twopenny skins, and their trumpery
shops; they opened the gates. Then the Ragusades began, and
happiness ended. The Empress was fooled, and the white banner
flaunted from the windows. The generals whom he had made his
nearest friends abandoned him for the Bourbons,--a set of people no
one had heard tell of. The Emperor bade us farewell at
Fontainebleau:--'Soldiers!'--I can hear him now; we wept like
children; the flags and the eagles were lowered as if for a
funeral: it was, I may well say it to you, it was the funeral of
the Empire; her dapper armies were nothing now but skeletons. So he
said to us, standing there on the portico of his palace:--'My
soldiers! we are vanquished by treachery; but we shall meet in
heaven, the country of the brave. Defend my child, whom I commit to
you. Long live Napoleon II!' He meant to die, that no man should
look upon Napoleon vanquished; he took poison, enough to have
killed a regiment, because, like Jesus Christ before his Passion,
he thought himself abandoned of God and his talisman. But the
poison did not hurt him.</p>
<p>"See again! he found he was immortal.</p>
<p>"Sure of himself, knowing he must ever be THE EMPEROR, he went
for a while to an island to study out the nature of these others,
who, you may be sure, committed follies without end. Whilst he
bided his time down there, the Chinese, and the wild men on the
coast of Africa, and the Barbary States, and others who are not at
all accommodating, knew so well he was more than man that they
respected his tent, saying to touch it would be to offend God.
Thus, d'ye see, when these others turned him from the doors of his
own France, he still reigned over the whole world. Before long he
embarked in the same little cockleshell of a boat he had had in
Egypt, sailed round the beard of the English, set foot in France,
and France acclaimed him. The sacred cuckoo flew from spire to
spire; all France cried out with one voice, 'LONG LIVE THE
EMPEROR!' In this region, here, the enthusiasm for that wonder of
the ages was, I may say, solid. Dauphin&eacute; behaved well; and I
am particularly pleased to know that her people wept when they saw,
once more, the gray overcoat. March first it was, when Napoleon
landed with two hundred men to conquer that kingdom of France and
of Navarre, which on the twentieth of the same month was again the
French Empire. On that day our MAN was in Paris; he had made a
clean sweep, recovered his dear France, and gathered his veterans
together by saying no more than three words, 'I am here.'</p>
<p>"'Twas the greatest miracle God had yet done! Before <i>him</i>,
did ever man recover an empire by showing his hat? And these
others, who thought they had subdued France! Not they! At sight of
the eagles, a national army sprang up, and we marched to Waterloo.
There, the Guard died at one blow. Napoleon, in despair, threw
himself three times before the cannon of the enemy without
obtaining death. We saw that. The battle was lost. That night the
Emperor called his old soldiers to him; on the field soaked with
our blood he burned his banner and his eagles,--his poor eagles,
ever victorious, who cried 'Forward' in the battles, and had flown
the length and breadth of Europe, <i>they</i> were saved the infamy
of belonging to the enemy: all the treasures of England couldn't
get her a tail-feather of them. No more eagles!--the rest is well
known. The Red Man went over to the Bourbons, like the scoundrel
that he is. France is crushed; the soldier is nothing; they deprive
him of his dues; they discharge him to make room for broken-down
nobles--ah, 'tis pitiable! They seized Napoleon by treachery; the
English nailed him on a desert island in mid-ocean on a rock raised
ten thousand feet above the earth; and there he is, and will be,
till the Red Man gives him back his power for the happiness of
France. These others say he's dead. Ha, dead! 'Tis easy to see they
don't know Him. They tell that fib to catch the people, and feel
safe in their hovel of a government. Listen! the truth at the
bottom of it all is that his friends have left him alone on the
desert island to fulfil a prophecy, for I forgot to say that his
name, Napoleon, means 'lion of the desert.' Now this that I tell
you is true as the Gospel. All other tales that you hear about the
Emperor are follies without common-sense; because, d'ye see, God
never gave to child of woman born the right to stamp his name in
red as <i>he</i> did, on the earth, which forever shall remember
him! Long live Napoleon, the father of his people and of the
soldier!"</p>
<p>"Long live General Ebl&eacute;!" cried the pontonier.</p>
<p>"How happened it you were not killed in the ravine at Moskova?"
asked a peasant woman.</p>
<p>"How do I know? We went in a regiment, we came out a hundred
foot-soldiers; none but the lines were capable of taking that
redoubt: the infantry, d'ye see, that's the real army."</p>
<p>"And the cavalry! what of that?" cried Genastas, letting himself
roll from the top of the hay, and appearing to us with a suddenness
which made the bravest utter a cry of terror. "Eh! my old veteran,
you forget the red lancers of Poniatowski, the cuirassiers, the
dragoons! they that shook the earth when Napoleon, impatient that
the victory was delayed, said to Murat, 'Sire, cut them in two.'
Ha, we were off! first at a trot, then at a gallop, 'one, two,' and
the enemy's line was cut in halves like an apple with a knife. A
charge of cavalry, my old hero! why, 'tis a column of cannon
balls!"</p>
<p>"How about the pontoniers?" cried Gondrin.</p>
<p>"My children," said Genastas, becoming suddenly quite ashamed of
his sortie when he saw himself in the midst of a silent and
bewildered group, "there are no spies here,--see, take this and
drink to the Little Corporal."</p>
<p>"LONG LIVE THE EMPEROR!" cried all the people present, with one
voice.</p>
<p>"Hush, my children!" said the officer, struggling to control his
emotion. "Hush! <i>he is dead</i>. He died saying, 'Glory, France,
and battle.' My friends, he had to die, he! but his
memory--never!"</p>
<p>Goguelat made a gesture of disbelief; then he said in a low
voice to those nearest, "The officer is still in the service, and
he's told to tell the people the Emperor is dead. We mustn't be
angry with him, because, d'ye see, a soldier has to obey
orders."</p>
<p>As Genestas left the barn he heard the Fosseuse say, "That
officer is a friend of the Emperor and of Monsieur Benassis." On
that, all the people rushed to the door to get another sight of
him, and by the light of the moon they saw the doctor take his
arm.</p>
<p>"I committed a great folly," said Genestas. "Let us get home
quickly. Those eagles--the cannon--the campaigns! I no longer knew
where I was."</p>
<p>"What do you think of my Goguelat?" asked Benassis.</p>
<p>"Monsieur, so long as such tales are told, France will carry in
her entrails the fourteen armies of the Republic, and may at any
time renew the conversation of cannon with all Europe. That's my
opinion."</p>

<h2>GEORGE <a name="BANCROFT"></a>BANCROFT</h2>

<br>

<p>he life of George Bancroft was nearly conterminous with the
nineteenth century. He was born at Worcester, Mass., October 3d,
1800, and died at Washington, D.C., January 17th, 1891. But it was
not merely the stretch of his years that identified him with this
century. In some respects he represented his time as no other of
its men. He came into touch with many widely differing elements
which made up its life and character. He spent most of his life in
cities, but never lost the sense for country sights and sounds
which central Massachusetts gave him in Worcester, his birthplace,
and in Northampton, where he taught school. The home into which he
was born offered him from his infancy a rich possession. His father
was a Unitarian clergyman who wrote a 'Life of Washington' that was
received with favor; thus things concerning God and country were
his patrimony. Not without significance was a word of his mother
which he recalled in his latest years, "My son, I do not wish you
to become a rich man, but I would have you be an affluent man:
<i>ad fluo</i>, always a little more coming in than going out."</p>
<p>To the advantages of his boyhood home and of Harvard College, to
which he went as a lad of thirteen, the eager young student added
the opportunity, then uncommon, of a systematic course of study in
German, and won the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at
G&ouml;ttingen in 1820. He had in a marked degree the
characteristics of his countrymen, versatility and adaptability.
Giving up an early purpose of fitting himself for the pulpit, he
taught in Harvard, and helped to found a school of an advanced type
at Northampton. Meantime he published a volume of verse, and found
out that the passionate love of poetry which lasted through his
life was not creative. At Northampton he published in 1828 a
translation in two volumes of Heeren's 'History of the Political
System of Europe,' and also edited two editions of a Latin Reader;
but the duties of a schoolmaster's life were early thrown aside,
and he could not be persuaded to resume them later when the
headship of an important educational institution was offered to
him. Together with the one great pursuit of his life, to which he
remained true for sixty years, he delighted in the activities of a
politician, the duties of a statesman, and the occupations of a man
of affairs and of the world.</p>

<br>
<p>Bancroft received a large but insufficient vote as the
Democratic candidate for the Governorship of Massachusetts, and for
a time he held the office of Collector of the port of Boston. As
Secretary of the Navy in the Cabinet of Polk, he rendered to his
country two distinct services of great value: he founded the Naval
School at Annapolis, and by his prompt orders to the American
commander in the Pacific waters he secured the acquisition of
California for the United States. The special abilities he
displayed in the Cabinet were such, so Polk thought, as to lead to
his appointment as Minister to England in 1846. He was a diplomat
of no mean order. President Johnson appointed him Minister to
Germany in 1867, and Grant retained him at that post until 1874, as
long as Bancroft desired it. During his stay there he concluded
just naturalization treaties with Germany, and in a masterly way
won from the Emperor, William I., as arbitrator, judgment in favor
of the United States's claim over that of Great Britain in the
Northwestern boundary dispute.</p>
<p>Always holding fast his one cherished object,--that of worthily
writing the history of the United States,--Bancroft did not deny
himself the pleasure of roaming in other fields. He wrote
frequently on current topics, on literary, historical, and
political subjects. His eulogies of Jackson and of Lincoln,
pronounced before Congress, entitle him to the rank of an orator.
He was very fond of studies in metaphysics, and Trendelenburg, the
eminent German philosopher, said of him, "Bancroft knows Kant
through and through."</p>
<p>His home--whether in Boston, or in New York where he spent the
middle portion of his life, or in Washington his abode for the last
sixteen years, or during his residence abroad--was the scene of the
occupations and delights which the highest culture craves. He was
gladly welcomed to the inner circle of the finest minds of Germany,
and the tribute of the German men of learning was unfeigned and
universal when he quitted the country in 1874. Many of the best men
of England and of France were among his warm friends. At his table
were gathered from time to time some of the world's greatest
thinkers,--men of science, soldiers, statesmen and men of affairs.
Fond as he was of social joys, it was his daily pleasure to mount
his horse and alone, or with a single companion, to ride where
nature in her shy or in her exuberant mood inspired. One day, after
he was eighty years old, he rode on his young, blooded Kentucky
horse along the Virginia bank of the Potomac for more than
thirty-six miles. He could be seen every day among the perfect
roses of his garden at "Roseclyffe," his Newport summer-home, often
full of thought, at other times in wellnigh boisterous glee, always
giving unstinted care and expense to the queen of flowers. The
books in which he kept the record of the rose garden were almost as
elaborate as those in which were entered the facts and fancies out
of which his History grew. His home life was charming. By a careful
use of opportunities and of his means he became an "affluent" man.
He was twice married: both times a new source of refined domestic
happiness long blessed his home, and new means for enlarged comfort
and hospitality were added to his own. Two sons, children of his
first wife, survived him.</p>
<p>Some of Bancroft's characteristics were not unlike those of
Jefferson. A constant tendency to idealize called up in him at
times a feeling verging on impatience with the facts or the men
that stood in the way of a theory or the accomplishment of a
personal desire. He had a keen perception of an underlying or a
final truth and professed warm love for it, whether in the large
range of history or in the nexus of current politics: any one
taking a different point of view at times was led to think that his
facts, as he stated them, lay crosswise, and might therefore find
the perspective out of drawing, but could not rightly impugn his
good faith.</p>
<p>Although a genuine lover of his race and a believer in
Democracy, he was not always ready to put implicit trust in the
individual as being capable of exercising a wise judgment and the
power of true self-direction. For man he avowed a perfect respect;
among men his bearing showed now and then a trace of condescension.
In controversies over disputed points of history--and he had many
such--he meant to be fair and to anticipate the final verdict of
truth, but overwhelming evidence was necessary to convince him that
his judgment, formed after painstaking research, could be wrong.
His ample love of justice, however, is proved by his passionate
appreciation of the character of Washington, by his unswerving
devotion to the conception of our national unity, both in its
historical development and at the moment when it was imperiled by
civil war, and by his hatred of slavery and of false financial
policies. He took pleasure in giving generously, but always
judiciously and without ostentation. On one occasion he, with a few
of his friends, paid off the debt from the house of an eminent
scholar; on another, he helped to rebuild for a great thinker the
home which had been burned. At Harvard, more than fifty years after
his graduation, he founded a traveling scholarship and named it in
honor of the president of his college days.</p>
<p>As to the manner of his work, Bancroft laid large plans and gave
to the details of their execution unwearied zeal. The scope of the
'History of the United States' as he planned it was admirable. In
carrying it out he was persistent in acquiring materials, sparing
no pains in his research at home and abroad, and no cost in
securing original papers or exact copies and transcripts from the
archives of England and France, Spain and Holland and Germany, from
public libraries and from individuals; he fished in all waters and
drew fish of all sorts into his net. He took great pains, and the
secretaries whom he employed to aid him in his work were instructed
likewise to take great pains, not only to enter facts in the
reference books in their chronological order, but to make all
possible cross-references to related facts. The books of his
library, which was large and rich in treasures, he used as tools,
and many of them were filled with cross references. In the
fly-leaves of the books he read he made note with a word and the
cited page of what the printed pages contained of interest to him
or of value in his work.</p>
<p>His mind was one of quick perceptions within a wide range, and
always alert to grasp an idea in its manifold relations. It is
remarkable, therefore, that he was very laborious in his method of
work. He often struggled long with a thought for intellectual
mastery. In giving it expression, his habit was to dictate rapidly
and with enthusiasm and at great length, but he usually selected
the final form after repeated efforts. His first draft of a chapter
was revised again and again and condensed. One of his early volumes
in its first manuscript form was eight times as long as when
finally published. He had another striking habit, that of writing
by topics rather than in strict chronological order, so that a
chapter which was to find its place late in the volume was often
completed before one which was to precede it. Partly by nature and
perhaps partly by this practice, he had the power to carry on
simultaneously several trains of thought. When preparing one of his
public orations, it was remarked by one of his household that after
an evening spent over a trifling game of bezique, the next morning
found him well advanced beyond the point where the work had been
seemingly laid down. He had the faculty of buoying a thought,
knowing just where to take it up after an interruption and deftly
splicing it in continuous line, sometimes after a long interval.
When about to begin the preparation of the argument which was to
sustain triumphantly the claim of the United States in the boundary
question, he wrote from Berlin for copies of documents filed in the
office of the Navy Department, which he remembered were there
five-and-twenty years before.</p>
<p>The 'History of the United States from the Discovery of America
to the Inauguration of Washington' is treated by Bancroft in three
parts. The first, Colonial History from 1492 to 1748, occupies more
than one fourth of his pages. The second part, the American
Revolution, 1748 to 1782, claims more than one half of the entire
work, and is divided into four epochs:--the first, 1748-1763, is
entitled 'The Overthrow of the European Colonial System'; the
second, 1763-1774, 'How Great Britain Estranged America'; the
third, 1774-1776, 'America Declares Itself Independent'; the
fourth, 1776-1782, 'The Independence of America is Acknowledged.'
The last part, 'The History of the Formation of the Constitution,'
1782-1789, though published as a separate work, is essentially a
continuation of the History proper, of which it forms in bulk
rather more than one tenth.</p>
<p>If his services as a historian are to be judged by any one
portion of his work rather than by another, the history of the
formation of the Constitution affords the best test. In that the
preceding work comes to fruition; the time of its writing, after
the Civil War and the consequent settling of the one vexing
question by the abolition of sectionalism, and when he was in the
fullness of the experience of his own ripe years, was most
opportune. Bancroft was equal to his opportunity. He does not teach
us that the Constitution is the result of superhuman wisdom, nor on
the other hand does he admit, as John Adams asserted, that however
excellent, the Constitution was wrung "from the grinding necessity
of a reluctant people." He does not fail to point out the critical
nature of the four years prior to the meeting of the Federal
Convention; but he discerns that whatever occasions, whether
transitory or for the time of "steady and commanding influence,"
may help or hinder the formation of the now perfect union, its true
cause was "an indwelling necessity" in the people to "form above
the States a common constitution for the whole."</p>
<p>Recognizing the fact that the primary cause for the true union
was remote in origin and deep and persistent, Bancroft gives a
retrospect of the steps toward union from the founding of the
colonies to the close of the war for independence. Thenceforward,
suggestions as to method or form of amending the Articles of
Confederation, whether made by individuals, or State Legislatures,
or by Congress, were in his view helps indeed to promote the
movement; but they were first of all so many proofs that despite
all the contrary wayward surface indications, the strong current
was flowing independently toward the just and perfect union. Having
acknowledged this fundamental fact of the critical years between
Yorktown and the Constitution, the historian is free to give just
and discriminating praise to all who shared at that time in
redeeming the political hope of mankind, to give due but not
exclusive honor to Washington and Thomas Paine, to Madison and
Hamilton and their co-worthies.</p>
<p>The many attempts, isolated or systematic, during the period
from 1781-1786, to reform the Articles of Confederation, were
happily futile; but they were essential in the training of the
people in the consciousness of the nature of the work for which
they are responsible. The balances must come slowly to a poise. Not
merely union strong and for a time effective, was needed, but union
of a certain and unprecedented sort: one in which the true pledge
of permanency for a continental republic was to be found in the
federative principle, by which the highest activities of nation and
of State were conditioned each by the welfare of the other. The
people rightly felt, too, that a Congress of one house would be
inadequate and dangerous. They waited in the midst of risks for the
proper hour, and then, not reluctantly but resolutely, adopted the
Constitution as a promising experiment in government.</p>
<p>Bancroft's treatment of the evolution of the second great
organic act of this time--the Northwestern ordinance--is no less
just and true to the facts. For two generations men had snatched at
the laurels due to the creator of that matchless piece of
legislation; to award them now to Jefferson, now to Nathan Dane,
now to Rufus King, now to Manasseh Cutler. Bancroft calmly and
clearly shows how the great law grew with the kindly aid and
watchful care of these men and of others.</p>
<p>The deliberations of the Federal Constitution are adequately
recorded; and he gives fair relative recognition to the work and
words of individuals, and the actions of State delegations in
making the great adjustments between nation and States, between
large and small and slave and free States. From his account we
infer that the New Jersey plan was intended by its authors only for
temporary use in securing equality for the States in one essential
part of the government, while the men from Connecticut receive
credit for the compromise which reconciled nationality with true
State rights. Further to be noticed are the results of the
exhaustive study which Bancroft gave to the matter of paper money,
and to the meaning of the clause prohibiting the States from
impairing the obligation of contracts. He devotes nearly one
hundred pages to 'The People of the States in Judgment on the
Constitution,' and rightly; for it is the final act of the separate
States, and by it their individual wills are merged in the will of
the people, which is one, though still politically distributed and
active within State lines. His summary of the main principles of
the Constitution is excellent; and he concludes with a worthy
sketch of the organization of the first Congress under the
Constitution, and of the inauguration of Washington as
President.</p>
<p>In this last portion of the 'History,' while all of his merits
as a historian are not conspicuous, neither are some of his chief
defects. Here the tendency to philosophize, to marshal stately
sentences, and to be discursive, is not so marked.</p>
<p>The first volume of Bancroft's 'History of the United States'
was published in 1834, when the democratic spirit was finding its
first full expression under Jackson, and when John Marshall was
finishing his mighty task of revealing to the people of the United
States the strength that lay in their organic law. As he put forth
volume after volume at irregular intervals for fifty years, he in a
measure continued this work of bringing to the exultant
consciousness of the people the value of their possession of a
continent of liberty and the realization of their responsibility.
In the course of another generation, portions of this 'History of
the United States' may begin to grow antiquated, though the most
brilliant of contemporary journalists quite recently placed it
among the ten books indispensable to every American; but time
cannot take away Bancroft's good part in producing influences,
which, however they may vary in form and force, will last
throughout the nation's life.</p>

<h3>THE BEGINNINGS OF VIRGINIA</h3>
<center>From 'History of the United States'</center>
<p>The period of success in planting Virginia had arrived; yet not
till changes in European politics and society had molded the forms
of colonization. The Reformation had broken the harmony of
religious opinion; and differences in the Church began to
constitute the basis of political parties. After the East Indies
had been reached by doubling the southern promontory of Africa, the
great commerce of the world was carried upon the ocean. The art of
printing had been perfected and diffused; and the press spread
intelligence and multiplied the facilities of instruction. The
feudal institutions, which had been reared in the middle ages, were
already undermined by the current of time and events, and, swaying
from their base, threatened to fall. Productive industry had built
up the fortunes and extended the influence of the active classes;
while habits of indolence and expense had impaired the estates and
diminished the power of the nobility. These changes produced
corresponding results in the institutions which were to rise in
America.</p>
<p>A revolution had equally occurred in the purposes for which
voyages were undertaken. The hope of Columbus, as he sailed to the
west, had been the discovery of a new passage to the East Indies.
The passion for gold next became the prevailing motive. Then the
islands and countries near the equator were made the tropical
gardens of the Europeans. At last, the higher design was matured:
to plant permanent Christian colonies; to establish for the
oppressed and the enterprising places of refuge and abode; to found
states in a temperate clime, with all the elements of independent
existence.</p>
<p>In the imperfect condition of industry, a redundant population
had existed in England even before the peace with Spain, which
threw out of employment the gallant men who had served under
Elizabeth by sea and land, and left them no option but to engage as
mercenaries in the quarrels of strangers, or incur the hazards of
"seeking a New World." The minds of many persons of intelligence
and rank were directed to Virginia. The brave and ingenious
Gosnold, who had himself witnessed the fertility of the western
soil, long solicited the concurrence of his friends for the
establishment of a colony, and at last prevailed with Edward Maria
Wingfield, a merchant of the west of England, Robert Hunt, a
clergyman of fortitude and modest worth, and John Smith, an
adventurer of rarest qualities, to risk their lives and hopes of
fortune in an expedition. For more than a year this little company
revolved the project of a plantation. At the same time Sir
Ferdinando Gorges was gathering information of the native
Americans, whom he had received from Waymouth, and whose
descriptions of the country, joined to the favorable views which he
had already imbibed, filled him with the strongest desire of
becoming a proprietary of domains beyond the Atlantic. Gorges was a
man of wealth, rank and influence; he readily persuaded Sir John
Popham, Lord Chief Justice of England, to share his intentions. Nor
had the assigns of Raleigh become indifferent to "western
planting"; which the most distinguished of them all, "industrious
Hakluyt," the historian of maritime enterprise, still promoted by
his personal exertions, his weight of character, and his invincible
zeal. Possessed of whatever information could be derived from
foreign sources and a correspondence with eminent navigators of his
times, and anxiously watching the progress of Englishmen in the
West, his extensive knowledge made him a counselor in every
colonial enterprise.</p>
<p>The King of England, too timid to be active, yet too vain to be
indifferent, favored the design of enlarging his dominions. He had
attempted in Scotland the introduction of the arts of life among
the Highlanders and the Western Isles, by the establishment of
colonies; and the Scottish plantations which he founded in the
northern counties of Ireland contributed to the affluence and the
security of that island. When, therefore, a company of men of
business and men of rank, formed by the experience of Gosnold, the
enthusiasm of Smith, the perseverance of Hakluyt, the influence of
Popham and Gorges, applied to James I. for leave "to deduce a
colony into Virginia," the monarch, on the tenth of April, 1606,
readily set his seal to an ample patent.</p>
<p>The first colonial charter, under which the English were planted
in America, deserves careful consideration.</p>

<h3>MEN AND GOVERNMENT IN EARLY MASSACHUSETTS</h3>
<center>From 'History of the United States'</center>
<p>These better auspices, and the invitations of Winthrop, won new
emigrants from Europe. During the long summer voyage of the two
hundred passengers who freighted the Griffin, three sermons a day
beguiled their weariness. Among them was Haynes, a man of very
large estate, and larger affections; of a "heavenly" mind, and a
spotless life; of rare sagacity, and accurate but unassuming
judgment; by nature tolerant, ever a friend to freedom, ever
conciliating peace; an able legislator; dear to the people by his
benevolent virtues and his disinterested conduct. Then also came
the most revered spiritual teachers of two commonwealths: the acute
and subtle Cotton, the son of a Puritan lawyer; eminent in
Cambridge as a scholar; quick in the nice perception of
distinctions, and pliant in dialects; in manner persuasive rather
than commanding; skilled in the fathers and the schoolmen, but
finding all their wisdom compactly stored in Calvin; deeply devout
by nature as well as habit from childhood; hating heresy and still
precipitately eager to prevent evil actions by suppressing ill
opinions, yet verging toward a progress in truth and in religious
freedom; an avowed enemy to democracy, which he feared as the blind
despotism of animal instincts in the multitude, yet opposing
hereditary power in all its forms; desiring a government of moral
opinion, according to the laws of universal equity, and claiming
"the ultimate resolution for the whole body of the people:" and
Hooker, of vast endowments, a strong will and an energetic mind;
ingenuous in his temper, and open in his professions; trained to
benevolence by the discipline of affliction; versed in tolerance by
his refuge in Holland; choleric, yet gentle in his affections; firm
in his faith, yet readily yielding to the power of reason; the peer
of the reformers, without their harshness; the devoted apostle to
the humble and the poor, severe toward the proud, mild in his
soothings of a wounded spirit, glowing with the raptures of
devotion, and kindling with the messages of redeeming love; his
eye, voice, gesture, and whole frame animate with the living vigor
of heart-felt religion; public-spirited and lavishly charitable;
and, "though persecutions and banishments had awaited him as one
wave follows another," ever serenely blessed with "a glorious peace
of soul"; fixed in his trust in Providence, and in his adhesion to
that cause of advancing civilization, which he cherished always,
even while it remained to him a mystery. This was he whom, for his
abilities and services, his contemporaries placed "in the first
rank" of men; praising him as "the one rich pearl, with which
Europe more than repaid America for the treasures from her coast."
The people to whom Hooker ministered had preceded him; as he landed
they crowded about him with their welcome. "Now I live," exclaimed
he, as with open arms he embraced them, "now I live if ye stand
fast in the Lord."</p>
<p>Thus recruited, the little band in Massachusetts grew more
jealous of its liberties. "The prophets in exile see the true forms
of the house." By a common impulse, the freemen of the towns chose
deputies to consider in advance the duties of the general court.
The charter plainly gave legislative power to the whole body of the
freemen; if it allowed representatives, thought Winthrop, it was
only by inference; and, as the whole people could not always
assemble, the chief power, it was argued, lay necessarily with the
assistants.</p>
<p>Far different was the reasoning of the people. To check the
democratic tendency, Cotton, on the election day, preached to the
assembled freemen against rotation in office. The right of an
honest magistrate to his place was like that of a proprietor to his
freehold. But the electors, now between three and four hundred in
number, were bent on exercising "their absolute power," and,
reversing the decision of the pulpit, chose a new governor and
deputy. The mode of taking the votes was at the same time reformed;
and, instead of the erection of hands, the ballot-box was
introduced. Thus "the people established a reformation of such
things as they judged to be amiss in the government."</p>
<p>It was further decreed that the whole body of the freemen should
be convened only for the election of the magistrates: to these,
with deputies to be chosen by the several towns, the powers of
legislation and appointment were henceforward intrusted. The
trading corporation was unconsciously become a representative
democracy.</p>
<p>The law against arbitrary taxation followed. None but the
immediate representatives of the people might dispose of lands or
raise money. Thus early did Massachusetts echo the voice of
Virginia, like deep calling unto deep. The state was filled with
the hum of village politicians; "the freemen of every town in the
Bay were busy in inquiring into their liberties and privileges."
With the exception of the principle of universal suffrage, now so
happily established, the representative democracy was as perfect
two centuries ago as it is to-day. Even the magistrates, who acted
as judges, held their office by the annual popular choice.
"Elections cannot be safe there long," said the lawyer Lechford.
The same prediction has been made these two hundred years. The
public mind, ever in perpetual agitation, is still easily shaken,
even by slight and transient impulses; but, after all vibrations,
it follows the laws of the moral world, and safely recovers its
balance.</p>

<h3>KING PHILIP'S WAR</h3>
<center>From 'History of the United States'</center>
<p>Thus was Philip hurried into "his rebellion"; and he is reported
to have wept as he heard that a white man's blood had been shed. He
had kept his men about him in arms, and had welcomed every
stranger; and yet, against his judgment and his will, he was
involved in war. For what prospect had he of success? The English
were united; the Indians had no alliance: the English made a common
cause; half the Indians were allies of the English, or were quiet
spectators of the fight: the English had guns enough; but few of
the Indians were well armed, and they could get no new supplies:
the English had towns for their shelter and safe retreat; the
miserable wigwams of the natives were defenseless: the English had
sure supplies of food; the Indians might easily lose their
precarious stores. Frenzy prompted their rising. They rose without
hope, and they fought without mercy. For them as a nation, there
was no to-morrow.</p>
<p>The minds of the English were appalled by the horrors of the
impending conflict, and superstition indulged in its wild
inventions. At the time of the eclipse of the moon, you might have
seen the figure of an Indian scalp imprinted on the centre of its
disk. The perfect form of an Indian bow appeared in the sky. The
sighing of the wind was like the whistling of bullets. Some heard
invisible troops of horses gallop through the air, while others
found the prophecy of calamities in the howling of the wolves.</p>
<p>At the very beginning of danger the colonists exerted their
wonted energy. Volunteers from Massachusetts joined the troops from
Plymouth; and, within a week from the commencement of hostilities,
the insulated Pokanokets were driven from Mount Hope, and in less
than a month Philip was a fugitive among the Nipmucks, the interior
tribes of Massachusetts. The little army of the colonists then
entered the territory of the Narragansetts, and from the reluctant
tribe extorted a treaty of neutrality, with a promise to deliver up
every hostile Indian. Victory seemed promptly assured. But it was
only the commencement of horrors. Canonchet, the chief sachem of
the Narragansetts, was the son of Miantonomoh; and could he forget
his father's wrongs? Desolation extended along the whole frontier.
Banished from his patrimony, where the pilgrims found a friend, and
from his cabin, which had sheltered the exiles, Philip, with his
warriors, spread through the country, awakening their brethren to a
warfare of extermination.</p>
<p>The war, on the part of the Indians, was one of ambuscades and
surprises. They never once met the English in open field; but
always, even if eightfold in numbers, fled timorously before
infantry. They were secret as beasts of prey, skillful marksmen,
and in part provided with firearms, fleet of foot, conversant with
all the paths of the forest, patient of fatigue, and mad with a
passion for rapine, vengeance, and destruction, retreating into
swamps for their fastnesses, or hiding in the greenwood thickets,
where the leaves muffled the eyes of the pursuer. By the rapidity
of their descent, they seemed omnipresent among the scattered
villages, which they ravished like a passing storm; and for a full
year they kept all New England in a state of terror and excitement.
The exploring party was waylaid and cut off, and the mangled
carcasses and disjointed limbs of the dead were hung upon the
trees. The laborer in the field, the reapers as they sallied forth
to the harvest, men as they went to mill, the shepherd's boy among
the sheep, were shot down by skulking foes, whose approach was
invisible. Who can tell the heavy hours of woman? The mother, if
left alone in the house, feared the tomahawk for herself and
children; on the sudden attack, the husband would fly with one
child, the wife with another, and, perhaps, one only escape; the
village cavalcade, making its way to meeting on Sunday in files on
horseback, the farmer holding the bridle in one hand and a child in
the other, his wife seated on a pillion behind him, it may be with
a child in her lap, as was the fashion in those days, could not
proceed safely; but, at the moment when least expected, bullets
would whizz among them, sent from an unseen enemy by the wayside.
The forest that protected the ambush of the Indians secured their
retreat.</p>

<h3>THE NEW NETHERLAND</h3>
<center>From 'History of the United States'</center>
<p>During the absence of Stuyvesant from Manhattan, the warriors of
the neighboring Algonkin tribes, never reposing confidence in the
Dutch, made a desperate assault on the colony. In sixty-four canoes
they appeared before the town, and ravaged the adjacent country.
The return of the expedition restored confidence. The captives were
ransomed, and industry repaired its losses. The Dutch seemed to
have firmly established their power, and promised themselves
happier years. New Netherland consoled them for the loss of Brazil.
They exulted in the possession of an admirable territory, that
needed no embankments against the ocean. They were proud of its
vast extent,--from New England to Maryland, from the sea to the
Great River of Canada, and the remote Northwestern wilderness. They
sounded with exultation the channel of the deep stream, which was
no longer shared with the Swedes; they counted with delight its
many lovely runs of water, on which the beavers built their
villages; and the great travelers who had visited every continent,
as they ascended the Delaware, declared it one of the noblest
rivers in the world, with banks more inviting than the lands on the
Amazon.</p>
<p>Meantime, the country near the Hudson gained by increasing
emigration. Manhattan was already the chosen abode of merchants;
and the policy of the government invited them by its good-will. If
Stuyvesant sometimes displayed the rash despotism of a soldier, he
was sure to be reproved by his employers. Did he change the rate of
duties arbitrarily, the directors, sensitive to commercial honor,
charged him "to keep every contract inviolate." Did he tamper with
the currency by raising the nominal value of foreign coin, the
measure was rebuked as dishonest. Did he attempt to fix the price
of labor by arbitrary rules, this also was condemned as unwise and
impracticable. Did he interfere with the merchants by inspecting
their accounts, the deed was censured as without precedent "in
Christendom"; and he was ordered to "treat the merchants with
kindness, lest they return, and the country be depopulated." Did
his zeal for Calvinism lead him to persecute Lutherans, he was chid
for his bigotry. Did his hatred of "the abominable sect of Quakers"
imprison and afterward exile the blameless Bowne, "let every
peaceful citizen," wrote the directors, "enjoy freedom of
conscience; this maxim has made our city the asylum for fugitives
from every land; tread in its steps, and you shall be blessed."</p>
<p>Private worship was therefore allowed to every religion.
Opinion, if not yet enfranchised, was already tolerated. The people
of Palestine, from the destruction of their temple an outcast and a
wandering race, were allured by the traffic and the condition of
the New World; and not the Saxon and Celtic races only, the
children of the bondmen that broke from slavery in Egypt, the
posterity of those who had wandered in Arabia, and worshiped near
Calvary, found a home, liberty, and a burial place on the island of
Manhattan.</p>
<p>The emigrants from Holland were themselves of the most various
lineage; for Holland had long been the gathering-place of the
unfortunate. Could we trace the descent of the emigrants from the
Low Countries to New Netherland, we should be carried not only to
the banks of the Rhine and the borders of the German Sea, but to
the Protestants who escaped from France after the massacre of
Bartholomew's Eve, and to those earlier inquirers who were swayed
by the voice of Huss in the heart of Bohemia. New York was always a
city of the world. Its settlers were relics of the first fruits of
the Reformation, chosen from the Belgic provinces and England, from
France and Bohemia, from Germany and Switzerland, from Piedmont and
the Italian Alps.</p>
<p>The religious sects, which, in the middle ages, had been
fostered by the municipal liberties of the south of France, were
the harbingers of modern freedom, and had therefore been sacrificed
to the inexorable feudalism of the north. After a bloody conflict,
the plebeian reformers, crushed by the merciless leaders of the
military aristocracy, escaped to the highlands that divide France
and Italy. Preserving the discipline of a benevolent, ascetic
morality, with the simplicity of a spiritual worship,</p>
<blockquote>"When all our fathers worshiped stocks and
stones,"</blockquote>
<p>it was found, on the progress of the Reformation, that they had
by three centuries anticipated Luther and Calvin. The hurricane of
persecution, which was to have swept Protestantism from the earth,
did not spare their seclusion; mothers with infants were rolled
down the rocks, and the bones of martyrs scattered on the Alpine
mountains. The city of Amsterdam offered the fugitive Waldenses a
free passage to America, and a welcome was prepared in New
Netherland for the few who were willing to emigrate.</p>
<p>The persecuted of every creed and every clime were invited to
the colony. When the Protestant churches in Rochelle were razed,
the Calvinists of that city were gladly admitted; and the French
Protestants came in such numbers that the public documents were
sometimes issued in French as well as in Dutch and English. Troops
of orphans were shipped for the milder destinies of the New World;
a free passage was offered to mechanics; for "population was known
to be the bulwark of every State." The government of New Netherland
had formed just ideas of the fit materials for building a
commonwealth; they desired "farmers and laborers, foreigners and
exiles, men inured to toil and penury." The colony increased;
children swarmed in every village; the advent of the year and the
month of May were welcomed with noisy frolics; new modes of
activity were devised; lumber was shipped to France; the whale
pursued off the coast; the vine, the mulberry, planted; flocks of
sheep as well as cattle were multiplied; and tile, so long imported
from Holland, began to be manufactured near Fort Orange. New
Amsterdam could, in a few years, boast of stately buildings, and
almost vied with Boston. "This happily situated province," said its
inhabitants, "may become the granary of our fatherland; should our
Netherlands be wasted by grievous wars, it will offer our
countrymen a safe retreat; by God's blessing, we shall in a few
years become a mighty people."</p>
<p>Thus did various nations of the Caucasian race assist in
colonizing our central states.</p>

<h3>FRANKLIN</h3>
<center>From 'History of the United States'</center>
<p>Franklin looked quietly and deeply into the secrets of nature.
His clear understanding was never perverted by passion, nor
corrupted by the pride of theory. The son of a rigid Calvinist, the
grandson of a tolerant Quaker, he had from boyhood been familiar
not only with theological subtilities, but with a catholic respect
for freedom of mind. Skeptical of tradition as the basis of faith,
he respected reason rather than authority; and, after a momentary
lapse into fatalism, he gained with increasing years an increasing
trust in the overruling providence of God. Adhering to none of all
the religions in the colonies, he yet devoutly, though without
form, adhered to religion. But though famous as a disputant, and
having a natural aptitude for metaphysics, he obeyed the tendency
of his age, and sought by observation to win an insight into the
mysteries of being. The best observers praise his method most. He
so sincerely loved truth, that in his pursuit of her she met him
half-way. Without prejudice and without bias, he discerned
intuitively the identity of the laws of nature with those of which
humanity is conscious; so that his mind was like a mirror, in which
the universe, as it reflected itself, revealed her laws. His
morality, repudiating ascetic severities and the system which
enjoins them, was indulgent to appetites of which he abhorred the
sway; but his affections were of a calm intensity: in all his
career, the love of man held the mastery over personal interest. He
had not the imagination which inspires the bard or kindles the
orator; but an exquisite propriety, parsimonious of ornament, gave
ease, correctness, and graceful simplicity even to his most
careless writings. In life, also, his tastes were delicate.
Indifferent to the pleasures of the table, he relished the delights
of music and harmony, of which he enlarged the instruments. His
blandness of temper, his modesty, the benignity of his manners,
made him the favorite of intelligent society; and, with healthy
cheerfulness, he derived pleasure from books, from philosophy, from
conversation,--now administering consolation to the sorrower, now
indulging in light-hearted gayety. In his intercourse, the
universality of his perceptions bore, perhaps, the character of
humor; but, while he clearly discerned the contrast between the
grandeur of the universe and the feebleness of man, a serene
benevolence saved him from contempt of his race or disgust at its
toils. To superficial observers, he might have seemed as an alien
from speculative truth, limiting himself to the world of the
senses; and yet, in study, and among men, his mind always sought to
discover and apply the general principles by which nature and
affairs are controlled,--now deducing from the theory of caloric
improvements in fireplaces and lanterns, and now advancing human
freedom by firm inductions from the inalienable rights of man.
Never professing enthusiasm, never making a parade of sentiment,
his practical wisdom was sometimes mistaken for the offspring of
selfish prudence; yet his hope was steadfast, like that hope which
rests on the Rock of Ages, and his conduct was as unerring as
though the light that led him was a light from heaven. He never
anticipated action by theories of self-sacrificing virtue; and yet,
in the moments of intense activity, he from the abodes of ideal
truth brought down and applied to the affairs of life the
principles of goodness, as unostentatiously as became the man who
with a kite and hempen string drew lightning from the skies. He
separated himself so little from his age that he has been called
the representative of materialism; and yet, when he thought on
religion, his mind passed beyond reliance on sects to faith in God;
when he wrote on politics, he founded freedom on principles that
know no change; when he turned an observing eye on nature, he
passed from the effect to the cause, from individual appearances to
universal laws; when he reflected on history, his philosophic mind
found gladness and repose in the clear anticipation of the progress
of humanity.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
